_Dialog between two observers of the_
_sailing race in 1851, later named  "The America’s Cup,"  which was the inspiration for John Cocke’s_
_naming of an IBM research processor as  "America,"  the first superscalar processor, and a precursor to the PowerPC._

Thus, the IA-64 gambles that, in the future, power will not be the critical limitation, and massive resources…will not penalize clock speed, path length, or CPI factors. My view is clearly skeptical…

_[Marty Hopkins (2000)](#_bookmark963), IBM Fellow and Early RISC pioneer commenting in 2000 on the new Intel Itanium, a joint development of Intel and HP. The Itanium used a static ILP approach (see Appendix H) and was a massive investment for Intel. It never accounted for more than 0.5% of Intel’s microprocessor sales._
