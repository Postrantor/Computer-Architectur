## Concluding Remarks

> ##总结

At the beginning of the 1980s, pipelining was a technique reserved primarily for supercomputers and large multimillion-dollar mainframes. By the mid-1980s, the first pipelined microprocessors appeared and helped transform the world of com- puting, allowing microprocessors to bypass minicomputers in performance and eventually to take on and outperform mainframes. By the early 1990s, high-end embedded microprocessors embraced pipelining, and desktops were headed toward the use of the sophisticated dynamically scheduled, multiple-issue approaches discussed in [Chapter 3](#_bookmark93). The material in this appendix, which was con- sidered reasonably advanced for graduate students when this text first appeared in 1990, is now considered basic undergraduate material and can be found in proces- sors that cost less than $1!

> 在 1980 年代初，管道是一种主要用于超级计算机和数百万美元的大型机的技术。到 1980 年代中期，第一批管道的微处理器出现并帮助改变了整合世界，使微处理器能够绕过性能中的微型计算机，并最终取得了大型计算机。到 1990 年代初，高端嵌入式微处理器采用管道式，台式机朝着使用[第 3 章]（#_ bookmark93）中讨论的复杂动态计划的，多发的方法的使用。本文在 1990 年首次出现时，本附录中的材料对研究生进行了合理的提升，现在被认为是基本的本科材料，可以在价格低于 1 美元的过程中找到！
