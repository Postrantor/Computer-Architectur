## Concluding Remarks

> ##总结

The landscape of large-scale multiprocessors has changed dramatically over the past five to ten years. While some form of clustering is now used for all the largest-scale multiprocessors, calling them all “clusters” ignores significant differ- ences in architecture, implementation style, cost, and performance.

Figure I.20 A classification of large-scale multiprocessors. The term _MPP,_ which had the original meaning described above, has been used more recently, and less precisely, to refer to all large-scale multiprocessors. None of the commercial shipping multiprocessors is a true MPP in the original sense of the word, but such an approach may make sense in the future. Both the SMP and DSM class includes multiprocessors with vector support. The term _constellation_ has been used in different ways; the above usage seems both intuitive and precise \[Dongarra et al. 2005\].

> 图 I.20 大规模多处理器的分类。_mpp 术语，_具有上述原始含义的术语，最近已被使用，而更确切地说是指所有大规模多处理器。从原始意义上讲，商业运输多处理器都不是真正的 MPP，但是将来这种方法可能是有意义的。SMP 和 DSM 类都包括具有向量支持的多处理器。术语_constellation_已以不同的方式使用；上述用法似乎既直觉又精确\ [Dongarra 等。2005 \]。

\[2002\] discussed this trend, arguing that clusters will dominate. While Dongarra et al. \[2005\] agreed that some form of clustering is almost inevitable in the largest multiprocessors, they developed a more nuanced classification that attempts to dis- tinguish among a variety of different approaches.

> \ [2002 \]讨论了这一趋势，认为集群将占主导地位。而 Dongarra 等。\ [2005 \]同意，在最大的多处理器中，某种形式的聚类几乎是不可避免的，他们开发了一种更细微的分类，试图在各种不同的方法中分辨出来。

In Figure I.20 we summarize the range of terminology that has been used for large-scale multiprocessors and focus on defining the terms from an architectural and implementation perspective. [Figure I.21](#_bookmark762) shows the hierarchical relationship of these different architecture approaches. Although there has been some conver- gence in architectural approaches over the past 15 years, the TOP500 list, which reports the 500 fastest computers in the world as measured by the Linpack bench- mark, includes commodity clusters, customized clusters, Symmetric Multiproces- sors (SMPs), DSMs, and constellations, as well as processors that are both scalar and vector.

> 在图 I.20 中，我们总结了已用于大规模多处理器的术语范围，并专注于从建筑和实施的角度定义术语。[图 I.21]（#_ bookmark762）显示了这些不同体系结构方法的层次关系。尽管过去 15 年来建筑方法有一些跨性别的趋势，但 Top500 列表报告了 Linpack-Mark 衡量的世界上 500 台最快的计算机，包括商品群集，定制群集，对称的多个群集，（SMP），DSM 和星座以及标量和向量的处理器。

Nonetheless, there are some clearly emerging trends, which we can see by looking at the distribution of types of multiprocessors in the TOP500 list:

> 但是，有一些显然的新兴趋势，我们可以通过查看 Top500 列表中多处理器类型的分布来看到这些趋势：

1. Clusters represent a majority of the systems. The lower development effort for clusters has clearly been a driving force in making them more popular. The high-end multiprocessor market has not grown sufficiently large to support full-scale, highly customized designs as the dominant choice.

> 1.簇代表大多数系统。群集的开发工作较低显然是使它们更受欢迎的推动力。高端多处理器市场尚未足够大，无法支持全尺度，高度定制的设计作为主要的选择。

2. The majority of the clusters are commodity clusters, often put together by users, rather than a system vendor designing a standard product.

> 2.大多数集群是商品簇，通常由用户组合在一起，而不是设计标准产品的系统供应商。

3. Although commodity clusters dominate in their representation, the top 25 entries on the list are much more varied and include 9 custom clusters (primarily instances of Blue Gene or Cray XT3 systems), 2 constellations, 8 commodity clusters, 2 SMPs (one of which is the NEC Earth Simulator, which has nodes with vector processors), and 4 DSM multiprocessors.

> 3.尽管商品集群在其代表性中占主导地位，但列表中的前 25 个条目更加多样化，包括 9 个自定义群集（主要是蓝色基因或 cray XT3 系统的实例），2 个星座，8 个商品群，2 个 SMPS（之一）这是 NEC Earth Simulator，具有带有矢量处理器的节点）和 4 个 DSM 多处理器。

4. Vector processors, which once dominated the list, have almost disappeared.

> 4.曾经统治列表的矢量处理器几乎消失了。

5. The IBM Blue Gene dominates the top 10 systems, showing the advantage of an approach the uses some commodity processor cores, but customizes many other functions and balances performance, power, and packaging density.

> 5. IBM Blue 基因主导了前 10 个系统，显示了一种方法的优势，该方法使用了一些商品处理器核心，但是自定义了许多其他功能和平衡性能，功率和包装密度。

6. Architectural convergence has been driven more by market effects(lack of growth, limited suppliers, etc.) than by a clear-cutconsensus on the best archi- tectural approaches.

> 6.与最佳的最佳构造方法相比，建筑融合受到市场影响（缺乏增长，有限的供应商等）的驱动。

Software, both applications and programming languages and environments, remains the big challenge for parallel computing, just as it was 30 years ago, when multiprocessors such as the Illiac IV were being designed. The combination of ease of programming with high parallel performance remains elusive. Until better pro- gress is made on this front, convergence toward a single programming model and underlying architectural approach (remembering that for uniprocessors we essen- tially have one programming model and one architectural approach!) will be slow or will be driven by factors other than proven architectural superiority.

> 就像 30 年前，当时正在设计诸如 Illiac IV 之类的多处理器一样，软件（应用程序和编程语言和环境都仍然是并行计算的最大挑战。编程易于性与高平行性能的结合仍然难以捉摸。在这方面做得更好之前，与单个编程模型和基本建筑方法的融合（请记住，对于单层处理器而言，我们本质上具有一个编程模型和一种建筑方法！）将是缓慢的，或者将由其他因素驱动的其他因素。比经过验证的建筑优势。
