## Concluding Remarks

> ##总结

Embedded systems are a very broad category of computing devices. This appendix has shown just some aspects of this. For example, the TI 320C55 DSP is a rela- tively “RISC-like” processor designed for embedded applications, with very fine-tuned capabilities. On the other end of the spectrum, the TI 320C64x is a very high-performance, eight-issue VLIW processor for very demanding tasks. Some processors must operate on battery power alone; others have the luxury of being plugged into line current. Unifying all of these is a need to perform some level of signal processing for embedded applications. Media extensions attempt to merge DSPs with some more general-purpose processing abilities to make these proces- sors usable for signal processing applications. We examined several case studies, including the Sony PlayStation 2, digital cameras, and cell phones. The PS2 per- forms detailed three-dimensional graphics, whereas a cell phone encodes and decodes signals according to elaborate communication standards. But both have system architectures that are very different from general-purpose desktop or server platforms. In general, architectural decisions that seem practical for general- purpose applications, such as multiple levels of caching or out-of-order superscalar execution, are much less desirable in embedded applications. This is due to chip area, cost, power, and real-time constraints. The programming model that these systems present places more demands on both the programmer and the compiler for extracting parallelism.

> 嵌入式系统是计算设备的非常广泛的类别。该附录仅显示了其中的某些方面。例如，TI 320C55 DSP 是一个相对的“ RISC 样”处理器，设计用于嵌入式应用程序，具有非常微调的功能。另一方面，TI 320C64X 是一个非常高性能的，八个问题的 VLIW 处理器，适用于非常苛刻的任务。一些处理器必须仅凭电池电量操作；其他人则可以将其插入线电流。统一所有这些是需要为嵌入式应用程序执行一定程度的信号处理。媒体扩展试图将 DSP 与一些更通用的处理能力合并，以使这些程序可用于信号处理应用程序。我们检查了一些案例研究，包括索尼 PlayStation 2，数码相机和手机。PS2 构成了详细的三维图形，而手机根据精心的通信标准对信号进行编码和解码。但是，两者的系统体系结构与通用台式机或服务器平台有很大不同。通常，在嵌入式应用程序中，对于通用目的应用似乎实用的建筑决策，例如多个缓存或级别超大标准执行，在嵌入式应用程序中不太希望。这是由于芯片区域，成本，功率和实时限制。这些系统提出的编程模型对程序员和编译器提取并行性的编译器提出了更多需求。
