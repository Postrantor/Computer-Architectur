## Dynamic Scheduling: Examples and the Algorithm

> ##动态调度：示例和算法

Before we examine Tomasulo’s algorithm in detail, let’s consider a few examples that will help illustrate how the algorithm works.

> 在我们详细检查 Tomasulo 的算法之前，让我们考虑一些示例，这些示例将有助于说明该算法的工作原理。

Example Show what the information tables look like for the following code sequence when only the first load has completed and written its result:

> 示例显示仅当第一个负载完成并写入结果时，信息表的样子：以下代码顺序：

_Answer_ [Figure 3.11](#_bookmark110) shows the result in three tables. The numbers appended to the names Add, Mult, and Load stand for the tag for that reservation station—Add1 is the tag for the result from the first add unit. In addition, we have included an instruction status table. This table is included only to help you understand the algorithm; it is _not_ actually a part of the hardware. Instead, the reservation station keeps the state of each operation that has issued.

> _answer_ [图 3.11](#_ bookmark110)在三个表中显示结果。附加到名称添加，多和负载架的数字为该预订站的标签 -  ADD1 是第一个添加单元结果的标签。此外，我们还提供了一个指令状态表。该表仅包括为了帮助您了解该算法；它实际上是硬件的一部分。相反，预订站保持了发行的每个操作的状态。

Tomasulo’s scheme offers two major advantages over earlier and simpler schemes: (1) the distribution of the hazard detection logic, and (2) the elimination of stalls for WAW and WAR hazards.

> Tomasulo 的计划提供了与较早和更简单的方案相比的两个主要优势：(1)危险检测逻辑的分布，以及(2)消除 WAW 和战争危害的摊位。

The first advantage arises from the distributed reservation stations and the use of the CDB. If multiple instructions are waiting on a single result, and each instruc- tion already has its other operand, then the instructions can be released simulta- neously by the broadcast of the result on the CDB. If a centralized register file were used, the units would have to read their results from the registers when reg- ister buses were available.

> 第一个优势来自分布式预订站和 CDB 的使用。如果多个指令正在等待单个结果，并且每种指令已经具有其他操作数，则可以通过 CDB 上的结果的广播同时释放说明。如果使用了集中式寄存器文件，则在可用的 Register Bus 时，单位必须从寄存器中读取其结果。

The second advantage, the elimination of WAW and WAR hazards, is accom- plished by renaming registers using the reservation stations and by the process of storing operands into the reservation station as soon as they are available.

> 第二个优点是消除 WAW 和战争危害，是通过使用预订站重命名登记册以及将操作数存储到预订站中的过程所产生的。

> For example, the code sequence in [Figure 3.11](#_bookmark110) issues both the fdiv.d and the eliminated in one of two ways. First, if the instruction providing the value for the fdiv.d has completed, then Vk will store the result, allowing fdiv.d to execute independent of the fadd.d (this is the case shown). On the other hand, if the fld hasn’t completed, then Qk will point to the Load1 reservation station, and the fdiv.d instruction will be independent of the fadd.d. Thus, in either case, the fadd.d can issue and begin executing. Any uses of the result of the fdiv.d will point to the reservation station, allowing the fadd.d to complete and store its value into the registers without affecting the fdiv.d.

>> 例如，[图 3.11]中的代码序列(#_ bookmark110)以两种方式之一发出了 fdiv.d 和删除。首先，如果提供了 FDIV.D 值的指令已经完成，则 VK 将存储结果，允许 FDIV.D 独立执行 FADD.D(如图所示)。另一方面，如果 FLD 尚未完成，则 QK 将指向 Load1 预订站，FDIV.D 指令将独立于 Fadd.D。因此，无论哪种情况，Fadd.D 都可以发行并开始执行。FDIV.D 结果的任何用途都将指向预订站，允许 FADD.D 完成并将其值存储到寄存器中，而不会影响 FDIV.D。

> Figure 3.11 Reservation stations and register tags shown when all of the instructions have issued but only the first load instruction has completed and written its result to the CDB. The second load has completed effective address calculation but is waiting on the memory unit. We use the array Regs\[ \] to refer to the register file and the array Mem\[ \] to refer to the memory. Remember that an operand is specified by either a Q field or a V field at any time. Notice that the fadd.d instruction, which has a WAR hazard at the WB stage, has issued and could complete before the fdiv.d initiates.

>> 图 3.11 预订站和寄存器标签显示了所有说明，但只有第一个负载指令已经完成并将其结果写入 CDB。第二个负载已完成有效的地址计算，但正在等待内存单元。我们使用数组 regs \ [\]参考寄存器文件和数组 mem \ [\]来参考内存。请记住，操作数在任何时候由 Q 字段或 V 字段指定。请注意，在 WB 阶段有战争危险的 Fadd.D 指示已在 FDIV.D 发起之前发布并可以完成。
>>

We’ll see an example of the elimination of a WAW hazard shortly. But let’s first look at how our earlier example continues execution. In this example, and the ones that follow in this chapter, assume the following latencies: load is 1 clock cycle, add is 2 clock cycles, multiply is 6 clock cycles, and divide is 12 clock cycles.

> 我们将在不久后看到消除 WAW 危险的例子。但是，让我们首先看一下我们之前的示例如何继续执行。在此示例中，以及本章遵循的示例，假设以下延迟：负载是 1 个时钟周期，添加为 2 个时钟周期，倍数为 6 个时钟周期，而划分为 12 个时钟周期。

Example Using the same code segment as in the previous example (page 201), show what the status tables look like when the fmul.d is ready to write its result.

> 示例使用与上一个示例(第 201 页)中相同的代码段的示例，显示 fmul.d 准备编写结果时的状态表的样子。

_Answer_ The result is shown in the three tables in [Figure 3.12](#_bookmark111). Notice that fadd.d has com- pleted because the operands of fdiv.d were copied, thereby overcoming the WAR hazard. Notice that even if the load of f6 was fdiv.d, the add into f6 could be executed without triggering a WAW hazard.

> _answer_结果在[图 3.12](#_ bookmark111)的三个表中显示。请注意，Fadd.D 已完成，因为 FDIV.D 的操作数被复制，从而克服了战争危险。请注意，即使 F6 的负载是 FDIV.D，也可以执行 F6 中的添加而不会触发 WAW 危险。

### Tomasulo’s Algorithm: The Details

> ### tomasulo 的算法：细节

[Figure 3.13](#_bookmark112) specifies the checks and steps that each instruction must go through. As mentioned earlier, loads and stores go through a functional unit for effective address computation before proceeding to independent load or store buffers. Loads take a second execution step to access memory and then go to Write Result to send the value from memory to the register file and/or any waiting reservation stations. Stores complete their execution in the Write Result stage, which writes the result to memory. Notice that all writes occur in Write Result, whether the destination is a register or memory. This restriction simplifies Tomasulo’s algorithm and is critical to its extension with speculation in [Section 3.6](#hardware-based-speculation).

> [图 3.13](#_ bookmark112)指定每个指令必须通过的检查和步骤。如前所述，在进行独立负载或存储缓冲区之前，负载和商店通过功能单元进行有效地址计算。负载采取第二个执行步骤以访问内存，然后去写入结果，以将值从内存发送到寄存器文件和/或任何等待的预订站。商店在写入结果阶段完成执行，将结果写入内存。请注意，所有写入都会在写入结果中发生，无论目标是寄存器还是内存。这种限制简化了 Tomasulo 的算法，对于[第 3.6 节](＃基于硬件的规范)中的猜测而言，它对于扩展至关重要。

### Tomasulo’s Algorithm: A Loop-Based Example

> ### tomasulo 的算法：基于循环的示例

To understand the full power of eliminating WAW and WAR hazards through dynamic renaming of registers, we must look at a loop. Consider the following sim- ple sequence for multiplying the elements of an array by a scalar in f2:

> 要通过动态重命名登记簿来了解消除 WAW 和战争危害的全部力量，我们必须研究一个循环。考虑以下模拟序列，以将阵列的元素乘以 F2 中的标量：

If we predict that branches are taken, using reservation stations will allow multiple executions of this loop to proceed at once. This advantage is gained without changing the code—in effect, the loop is unrolled dynamically by the hard- ware using the reservation stations obtained by renaming to act as additional registers.

> 如果我们预测将分支机构采用，使用预订站将允许该循环的多次执行立即进行。在没有更改代码的情况下获得了这一优势 - 效果，使用重命名作为其他寄存器而获得的预订站，固定器可以动态播放循环。

Let’s assume we have issued all the instructions in two successive iterations of the loop, but none of the floating-point load/stores or operations have com- pleted. [Figure 3.14](#_bookmark113) shows reservation stations, register status tables, and load and store buffers at this point. (The integer ALU operation is ignored, and it is assumed the branch was predicted as taken.) Once the system reaches this state, two copies of the loop could be sustained with a CPI close to 1.0, provided the multiplies could complete in four clock cycles. With a latency of six cycles, additional iterations will need to be processed before the steady state can be reached. This requires more reservation stations to hold instructions that are in execution. As we will see later in this chapter, when extended with multiple issue instructions, Tomasulo’s approach can sustain more than one instruction per clock.

> 假设我们已经在循环的两个连续迭代中发布了所有说明，但是没有一个浮点负载/商店或操作都完成了。[图 3.14](#_ bookmark113)此时显示预订站，寄存器状态表以及加载和存储缓冲区。(整数 Alu 操作被忽略，并假定该分支被预测为采用。)一旦系统到达该状态，只要可以在四个时钟乘以乘坐乘积，就可以使用 CPI 接近 1.0 的 CPI 维持两个环的副本。周期。有六个周期的延迟，需要在达到稳态之前进行额外的迭代。这需要更多的预订站来保留执行中的指示。正如我们将在本章稍后看到的那样，当使用多个问题说明扩展时，Tomasulo 的方法可以维持一个以上的指令。

A load and a store can be done safely out of order, provided they access dif- ferent addresses. If a load and a store access the same address, one of two things happens:

> 只要访问不同的地址，就可以安全地完成负载和商店。如果负载和商店访问相同的地址，则会发生两件事之一：

Figure 3.13 Steps in the algorithm and what is required for each step. For the issuing instruction, rd is the des- tination, rs and rt are the source register numbers, imm is the sign-extended immediate field, and r is the reser- vation station or buffer that the instruction is assigned to. RS is the reservation station data structure. The value returned by an FP unit or by the load unit is called result. RegisterStat is the register status data structure (not the register file, which is Regs\[\]). When an instruction is issued, the destination register has its Qi field set to the number of the buffer or reservation station to which the instruction is issued. If the operands are available in the registers, they are stored in the V fields. Otherwise, the Q fields are set to indicate the reservation station that will produce the values needed as source operands. The instruction waits at the reservation station until both its operands are available, indicated by zero in the Q fields. The Q fields are set to zero either when this instruction is issued or when an instruction on which this instruction depends completes and does its write back. When an instruction has finished execution and the CDB is available, it can do its write back. All the buffers, registers, and reservation stations whose values of Qj or Qk are the same as the completing reservation station update their values from the CDB and mark the Q fields to indicate that values have been received. Thus the CDB can broadcast its result to many destinations in a single clock cycle, and if the waiting instructions have their operands, they can all begin execution on the next clock cycle. Loads go through two steps in execute, and stores perform slightly differently during Write Result, where they may have to wait for the value to store. Remember that, to preserve exception behav- ior, instructions should not be allowed to execute if a branch that is earlier in program order has not yet completed. Because no concept of program order is maintained after the issue stage, this restriction is usually implemented by preventing any instruction from leaving the issue step if there is a pending branch already in the pipeline. In [Section 3.6](#hardware-based-speculation), we will see how speculation support removes this restriction.

> 图 3.13 算法中的步骤以及每个步骤所需的内容。对于发行指令，RD 是 DES 的，RS 和 RT 是源寄存器编号，IMM 是签名扩展的即时字段，R 是将指令分配给的放置站或缓冲区。RS 是预订站数据结构。FP 单元或负载单元返回的值称为结果。registerstat 是寄存器状态数据结构(不是寄存器文件，是 regs \ [\])。发出指令后，目标寄存器将其 QI 字段设置为发行指令的缓冲区或预订站的数量。如果操作数在寄存器中可用，则将它们存储在 V 字段中。否则，Q 字段设置为指示将产生作为源操作数所需值的预订站。该指令在预订站等待，直到其两个操作数可用，Q 字段中的零表示为零。发出此指令或本指令依赖的指令完成并将其写回时，将 Q 字段设置为零。当指令完成执行并可用时，它可以回信。所有的缓冲区，寄存器和预订站的 QJ 或 QK 值与完成的预订站相同，从 CDB 更新其值并标记 Q 字段以表明已接收值。因此，CDB 可以在单个时钟周期中将其结果广播到许多目的地，如果等待说明具有其操作数，则可以在下一个时钟周期开始执行。负载经历了执行的两个步骤，并且在写入结果期间，商店的性能略有不同，他们可能必须等待该值存储。请记住，为了保留异常行为，如果尚未完成计划顺序的分支，则不应允许执行指令。由于在发行阶段之后没有任何程序顺序的概念，因此通常可以通过防止任何指令离开问题步骤来实现此限制。在[第 3.6 节](＃基于硬件的规范)中，我们将看到投机支持如何消除这一限制。

Figure 3.14 Two active iterations of the loop with no instruction yet completed. Entries in the multiplier reser- vation stations indicate that the outstanding loads are the sources. The store reservation stations indicate that the multiply destination is the source of the value to store.

> 图 3.14 循环的两个主动迭代尚未完成。乘数排列站中的条目表明未偿还的负载是来源。商店预订站表明，乘数目的地是要存储的值的来源。

- The load is before the store in program order and interchanging them results in a WAR hazard.

> - 负载是按计划顺序按计划顺序进行的，并将其互换导致战争危险。

- The store is before the load in program order and interchanging them results in a RAW hazard.

> - 商店是按计划顺序负载之前的，并互换它们会导致原始危害。

Similarly, interchanging two stores to the same address results in a WAW hazard. Therefore, to determine if a load can be executed at a given time, the processor can check whether any uncompleted store that precedes the load in program order shares the same data memory address as the load. Similarly, a store must wait until there are no unexecuted loads or stores that are earlier in program order and share the same data memory address. We consider a method to eliminate this restriction in [Section 3.9](#advanced-techniques-for-instruction-delivery-and-speculation).

> 同样，将两个商店互换到相同的地址会导致危险危险。因此，为了确定是否可以在给定时间执行负载，处理器可以检查程序顺序中的负载之前是否有任何未完成的存储者共享与负载相同的数据存储器地址。同样，商店必须等到没有执行订单较早的未执行的负载或商店并共享相同的数据存储器地址。我们考虑了在[3.9]中消除这种限制的方法(＃高级教学 - 授课和规范)。

To detect such hazards, the processor must have computed the data memory address associated with any earlier memory operation. A simple, but not necessar- ily optimal, way to guarantee that the processor has all such addresses is to perform the effective address calculations in program order. (We really only need to keep the relative order between stores and other memory references; that is, loads can be reordered freely.)

> 为了检测此类危害，处理器必须计算出与任何早期内存操作关联的数据存储器地址。保证处理器拥有所有此类地址的一种简单但不必要的最佳方法是按程序顺序执行有效的地址计算。(实际上，我们只需要保持商店和其他内存引用之间的相对顺序；也就是说，可以自由地重新排序负载。)

Let’s consider the situation of a load first. If we perform effective address calculation in program order, then when a load has completed effective address calculation, we can check whether there is an address conflict by examining the A field of all active store buffers. If the load address matches the address of any active entries in the store buffer, that load instruction is not sent to the load buffer until the conflicting store completes. (Some implementations bypass the value directly to the load from a pending store, reducing the delay for this RAW hazard.)

> 让我们首先考虑负载的情况。如果我们按程序顺序执行有效的地址计算，那么当负载完成有效的地址计算时，我们可以通过检查所有活动商店缓冲区的 A 字段来检查地址冲突。如果加载地址与商店缓冲区中任何活动条目的地址匹配，则该加载指令在矛盾的商店完成之前，该加载指令均未发送到加载缓冲区。(某些实现的值直接从待处理的商店绕过负载，从而减少了这种原始危害的延迟。)

Stores operate similarly, except that the processor must check for conflicts in both the load buffers and the store buffers because conflicting stores cannot be reordered with respect to either a load or a store.

> 商店的运营方式类似，除了处理器必须检查负载缓冲区和商店缓冲区中的冲突，因为无法相对于负载或商店重新排序冲突的商店。

A dynamically scheduled pipeline can yield very high performance, pro- vided branches are predicted accurately—an issue we addressed in the previous section. The major drawback of this approach is the complexity of the Toma- sulo scheme, which requires a large amount of hardware. In particular, each reservation station must contain an associative buffer, which must run at high speed, as well as complex control logic. The performance can also be limited by the single CDB. Although additional CDBs can be added, each CDB must interact with each reservation station, and the associative tag-matching hard- ware would have to be duplicated at each station for each CDB. In the 1990s, only high-end processors could take advantage of dynamic scheduling (and its extension to speculation); however, recently even processors designed for PMDs are using these techniques, and processors for high-end desktops and small servers have hundreds of buffers to support dynamic scheduling.

> 动态计划的管道可以准确地预测出非常高的性能，这是我们在上一节中解决的问题。这种方法的主要缺点是 Toma-Sulo 方案的复杂性，该方案需要大量的硬件。特别是，每个预订站必须包含一个必须高速运行的关联缓冲区以及复杂的控制逻辑。性能也可以受到单个 CDB 的限制。尽管可以添加其他 CDB，但每个 CDB 都必须与每个预订站进行交互，并且必须在每个 CDB 的每个站点重复使用关联标签硬件。在 1990 年代，只有高端处理器可以利用动态调度(及其扩展到投机)；但是，最近即使是为 PMD 设计的处理器也正在使用这些技术，而用于高端台式机和小型服务器的处理器也有数百个缓冲区以支持动态调度。

In Tomasulo’s scheme, two different techniques are combined: the renaming of the architectural registers to a larger set of registers and the buffering of source operands from the register file. Source operand buffering resolves WAR hazards that arise when the operand is available in the registers. As we will see later, it is also possible to eliminate WAR hazards by the renaming of a register together with the buffering of a result until no outstanding references to the earlier version of the register remain. This approach will be used when we discuss hardware speculation.

> 在 Tomasulo 的方案中，结合了两种不同的技术：将建筑寄存器重命名为较大的寄存器以及从寄存器文件中对源操作数的缓冲。来源操作数缓冲可以解决寄存器中有操作数时出现的战争危害。正如我们稍后将看到的那样，还可以通过重命名登记册以及结果来消除战争危害，直到没有对早期版本的登记簿保留为止。当我们讨论硬件猜测时，将使用此方法。

Tomasulo’s scheme was unused for many years after the 360/91, but was widely adopted in multiple-issue processors starting in the 1990s for several reasons:

> 360/91 之后，Tomasulo 的计划在多年后没有使用，但在 1990 年代开始在多发处理器中广泛采用，原因有几个：

1. Although Tomasulo’s algorithm was designed before caches, the presence of caches, with the inherently unpredictable delays, has become one of the major motivations for dynamic scheduling. Out-of-order execution allows the proces- sors to continue executing instructions while awaiting the completion of a cache miss, thus hiding all or part of the cache miss penalty.

> 1.尽管 Tomasulo 的算法是在缓存之前设计的，但由于固有的不可预测的延迟，缓存的存在已成为动态调度的主要动机之一。端外执行允许这些措施继续执行指令，同时等待缓存失误的完成，从而隐藏所有或部分缓存罚款。

2. As processors became more aggressive in their issue capability and designers were concerned with the performance of difficult-to-schedule code (such as most nonnumeric code), techniques such as register renaming, dynamic sched- uling, and speculation became more important.

> 2.随着处理器在发行能力上变得更加积极，设计师关注的是难以进行安排代码的性能(例如大多数非数字代码)，诸如登记册重命名，动态调度和猜测等技术变得更加重要。

3. It can achieve high performance without requiring the compiler to target code to a specific pipeline structure, a valuable property in the era of shrink-wrapped mass market software.

> 3.它可以实现高性能，而无需编译器将特定管道结构定为目标代码，这是在收缩包裹的大众市场软件时代的宝贵属性。
