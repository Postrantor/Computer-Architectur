The turning away from the conventional organization came in the middle 1960s, when the law of diminishing returns began to take effect in the effort to increase the operational speed of a computer.

. . . Electronic circuits are ultimately limited in their speed of operation by the speed of light . . . and many of the circuits were already operating in the nanosecond range.

We are dedicating all of our future product development to multicore designs. We believe this is a key inflection point for the industry.

Intel President Paul Otellini, _describing Intel_’_s future direction at the Intel Developer Forum in 2005_

Since 2004 processor designers have increased core counts to exploit Moore’s Law scaling, rather than focusing on single-core performance. The failure of Dennard scaling, to which the shift to multicore parts is partially a response, may soon limit multicore scaling just as single-core scaling has been curtailed.
