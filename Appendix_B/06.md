## Concluding Remarks

The difficulty of building a memory system to keep pace with faster processors is underscored by the fact that the raw material for main memory is the same as that found in the cheapest computer. It is the principle of locality that helps us hereâ€”its soundness is demonstrated at all levels of the memory hierarchy in current com- puters, from disks to TLBs.

However, the increasing relative latency to memory, taking hundreds of clock cycles in 2016, means that programmers and compiler writers must be aware of the parameters of the caches and TLBs if they want their programs to perform well.
