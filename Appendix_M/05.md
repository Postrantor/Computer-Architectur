The earliest computers, including the UNIVAC I, the EDSAC, and the IAS computers, were accumulator-based computers. The simplicity of this type of computer made it the natural choice when hardware resources were very con- strained. The first general-purpose register computer was the Pegasus, built by Ferranti, Ltd., in 1956. The Pegasus had eight general-purpose registers, with R0 always being zero. Block transfers loaded the eight registers from the drum memory.

> 最早的计算机，包括 Univac I，EDSAC 和 IAS 计算机，是基于累加器的计算机。当硬件资源非常稳定时，这种计算机的简单性使其成为自然的选择。第一台通用寄存器计算机是由 Ferranti，Ltd。建造的 Pegasus。块转移从鼓内存中加载了八个寄存器。

### Stack Architectures

> ###堆栈体系结构

In 1963, Burroughs delivered the B5000. The B5000 was perhaps the first com- puter to seriously consider software and hardware-software trade-offs. Barton and the designers at Burroughs made the B5000 a stack architecture (as described in Barton [1961]). Designed to support high-level languages such as ALGOL, this stack architecture used an operating system (MCP) written in a high-level lan- guage. The B5000 was also the first computer from a U.S. manufacturer to support virtual memory. The B6500, introduced in 1968 (and discussed in Hauck and Dent [1968]), added hardware-managed activation records. In both the B5000 and B6500, the top two elements of the stack were kept in the processor and the rest of the stack was kept in memory. The stack architecture yielded good code density, but only provided two high-speed storage locations. The authors of both the orig- inal IBM 360 paper [Amdahl, Blaauw, and Brooks 1964] and the original PDP-11 paper [Bell et al. 1970] argued against the stack organization. They cited three major points in their arguments against stacks:

> 1963 年，Burroughs 交付了 B5000。B5000 也许是第一个认真考虑软件和硬件软件权衡的委员会。Barton 和 Burroughs 的设计师使 B5000 成为堆栈建筑(如 Barton [1961]中所述)。该堆栈体系结构旨在支持高级语言，例如 Algol，使用了用高级语言编写的操作系统(MCP)。B5000 也是美国制造商支持虚拟内存的第一台计算机。B6500 于 1968 年推出(并在 Hauck and Dent [1968]中进行了讨论)，添加了硬件管理的激活记录。在 B5000 和 B6500 中，堆栈的前两个元素都保存在处理器中，其余的堆栈保存在记忆中。堆栈体系结构产生了良好的代码密度，但仅提供了两个高速存储位置。原始 IBM 360 论文的作者[Amdahl，Blaauw 和 Brooks 1964]和原始 PDP-11 论文[Bell 等。[1970 年]反对堆栈组织。他们在反对堆栈的论点中引用了三个主要要点：

- Performance is derived from fast registers, not the way they are used.

> - 性能来自快速寄存器，而不是使用它们的使用方式。

- The stack organization is too limiting and requires many swap and copy operations.

> - 堆栈组织太限制了，需要许多交换和复制操作。

- The stack has a bottom, and when placed in slower memory there is a performance loss.

> - 堆栈具有底部，当放置在较慢的内存中时，会有性能损失。

Stack-based hardware fell out of favor in the late 1970s and, except for the Intel 80x86 floating-point architecture, essentially disappeared; for example, except for the 80x86, none of the computers listed in the SPEC report uses a stack.

> 基于堆栈的硬件在 1970 年代后期就不受欢迎，除了英特尔 80x86 浮点数架构外，基本上消失了。例如，除 80x86 外，规格报告中列出的计算机均未使用堆栈。

In the 1990s, however, stack architectures received a shot in the arm with the success of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM is a software interpreter for an intermediate language produced by Java compilers, called _Java bytecodes_ [Lindholm and Yellin 1999]. The purpose of the interpreter is to provide software compatibility across many platforms, with the hope of “write once, run every- where.” Although the slowdown is about a factor of 10 due to interpretation, there are times when compatibility is more important than performance, such as when downloading a Java “applet” into an Internet browser.

> 然而，在 1990 年代，Stack Architectures 在 Java Virtual Machine(JVM)的成功中获得了手臂射击。JVM 是 Java 编译器生产的中间语言的软件解释，称为_JAVA BYTECODES_ [LINDHOLM 和 YELLIN 1999]。解释器的目的是在许多平台上提供软件兼容性，并希望“写一次，运行每一个地方”。尽管由于解释而放缓大约是 10 倍，但有时兼容性比性能更重要，例如将 Java“ applet”下载到 Internet 浏览器中时。

Although a few have proposed hardware to directly execute the JVM instruc- tions (see McGhan and O’Connor [1998]), thus far none of these proposals has been significant commercially. The hope instead is that _just-in-time_ (JIT) Java compilers—which compile during runtime to the native instruction set of the computer running the Java program—will overcome the performance penalty of interpretation. The popularity of Java has also led to compilers that compile directly into the native hardware instruction sets, bypassing the illusion of the Java bytecodes.

> 尽管有一些提议的硬件直接执行 JVM 指导(请参阅 McGhan 和 O’Connor [1998])，但到目前为止，这些建议都没有在商业上很重要。希望相反，_ Just-In-time_(jit)Java 编译器(在运行时编译为运行 Java 程序的计算机的本机指令集)将克服解释的性能罚款。Java 的受欢迎程度还导致编译器直接编译为本机硬件指令集，绕过 Java Bytecodes 的幻觉。

### Computer Architecture Defined

> ###计算机架构定义

IBM coined the term _computer architecture_ in the early 1960s. Amdahl, Blaauw, and Brooks [1964] used the term to refer to the programmer-visible portion of the IBM 360 instruction set. They believed that a _family_ of computers of the same architecture should be able to run the same software. Although this idea may seem obvious to us today, it was quite novel at that time. IBM, although it was the lead- ing company in the industry, had five different architectures before the 360; thus, the notion of a company standardizing on a single architecture was a radical one. The 360 designers hoped that defining a common architecture would bring six different divisions of IBM together. Their definition of architecture was

> IBM 在 1960 年代初创建了术语_Computer 架构_。Amdahl，Blaauw 和 Brooks [1964]使用该术语指的是 IBM 360 指令集的程序员可见部分。他们认为，同一体系结构的计算机的_family_应该能够运行相同的软件。尽管今天对我们来说这个想法似乎很明显，但那时候很新颖。IBM 虽然是该行业的领导公司，但在 360 年之前拥有五个不同的建筑。因此，在单个体系结构上标准化的公司的概念是一种根本性的。这位 360 名设计师希望定义共同的体系结构能将 IBM 的六个不同部门聚集在一起。他们对建筑的定义是

… _the structure of a computer that a machine language programmer must understand to write a correct (timing independent) program for that machine._

> …机器语言程序员必须理解的计算机结构必须为该机器编写正确的(时间独立)程序。

The term _machine language programmer_ meant that compatibility would hold, even in machine language, while _timing independent_ allowed different implemen- tations. This architecture blazed the path for binary compatibility, which others have followed.

> 术语_machine 语言程序员_意味着即使在机器语言中，兼容性也可以保持，而_ timing Independent_则允许不同的启动。这种体系结构为二进制兼容性奠定了道路，其他人则遵循了二进制兼容性。

The IBM 360 was the first computer to sell in large quantities with both byte addressing using 8-bit bytes and general-purpose registers. The 360 also had register-memory and limited memory-memory instructions. Appendix K summa- rizes this instruction set.

> IBM 360 是第一台大量出售的计算机，使用 8 位字节和通用寄存器的字节解决方案。360 还具有寄存器记录和有限的内存记忆说明。附录 K 概括了此指令集。

In 1964, Control Data delivered the first supercomputer, the CDC 6600. As Thornton [1964] discussed, he, Cray, and the other 6600 designers were among the first to explore pipelining in depth. The 6600 was the first general-purpose, load-store computer. In the 1960s, the designers of the 6600 realized the need to simplify architecture for the sake of efficient pipelining. Microprocessor and minicomputer designers largely neglected this interaction between architectural simplicity and implementation during the 1970s, but it returned in the 1980s.

> 1964 年，控制数据传递了第一个超级计算机 CDC6600。正如 Thornton [1964]所讨论的那样，HE，Cray 和其他 6600 名设计师是最早探索管道深入探索管道的人之一。6600 是第一台通用的，负载商店的计算机。在 1960 年代，6600 年的设计师意识到为了有效的管道而言，有必要简化体系结构。微处理器和微型计算机设计师在很大程度上忽略了 1970 年代建筑简单性和实施之间的这种相互作用，但它在 1980 年代恢复了。

### High-Level Language Computer Architecture

> ###高级语言计算机体系结构

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, people realized that software costs were growing faster than hardware costs. McKeeman [1967] argued that compilers and operating systems were getting too big and too complex and taking too long to develop. Because of inferior compilers and the memory limitations of computers, most systems programs at the time were still written in assembly language. Many researchers proposed alleviating the software crisis by creating more powerful, software-oriented architectures. Tanenbaum [1978] studied the properties of high-level languages. Like other researchers, he found that most programs are sim- ple. He argued that architectures should be designed with this in mind and that they should optimize for program size and ease of compilation. Tanenbaum proposed a stack computer with frequency-encoded instruction formats to accomplish these goals; however, as we have observed, program size does not translate directly to cost-performance, and stack computers faded out shortly after this work.

> 在 1960 年代末和 1970 年代初，人们意识到软件成本的增长速度比硬件成本快。McKeeman [1967]认为，编译器和操作系统变得太大，太复杂，花了太长时间而无法发展。由于编译器的劣质和计算机的内存限制，当时的大多数系统程序仍以汇编语言编写。许多研究人员提出，通过创建更强大，面向软件的体系结构来减轻软件危机。Tanenbaum [1978]研究了高级语言的属性。像其他研究人员一样，他发现大多数程序都是模拟的。他认为，应牢记这一架构，并应为程序规模和易于编译而进行优化。Tanenbaum 提出了一台带有频率编码的指令格式的堆栈计算机，以实现这些目标；但是，正如我们已经观察到的那样，程序规模并不能直接转化为成本绩效，并且在这项工作后不久，堆叠计算机逐渐消失。

Strecker’s article [1978] discusses how he and the other architects at DEC responded to this by designing the VAX architecture. The VAX was designed to simplify compilation of high-level languages. Compiler writers had complained about the lack of complete orthogonality in the PDP-11. The VAX architecture was designed to be highly orthogonal and to allow the mapping of a high-level language statement into a single VAX instruction. Additionally, the VAX designers tried to optimize code size because compiled programs were often too large for available memories. Appendix K summarizes this instruction set.

> Strecker 的文章[1978]讨论了他和 DEC 的其他工程师如何通过设计 VAX 架构来对此做出回应。VAX 旨在简化高级语言的汇编。编译器作家抱怨 PDP-11 中缺乏完全正交性。VAX 架构设计为高度正交，并允许将高级语言语句映射到单个 VAX 指令中。此外，VAX 设计人员试图优化代码大小，因为编译的程序通常太大，无法进行可用的记忆。附录 K 总结了此指令集。

The VAX-11/780 was the first computer announced in the VAX series. It is one of the most successful—and most heavily studied—computers ever built. The cornerstone of DEC’s strategy was a single architecture, VAX, running a sin- gle operating system, VMS. This strategy worked well for over 10 years. The large number of papers reporting instruction mixes, implementation measurements, and analysis of the VAX makes it an ideal case study [Clark and Levy 1982; Wiecek 1982]. Bhandarkar and Clark [1991] gave a quantitative analysis of the disadvan- tages of the VAX versus a RISC computer, essentially a technical explanation for the demise of the VAX.

> VAX-11/780 是 VAX 系列中宣布的第一台计算机。它是有史以来最成功，也是最受研究的最广泛研究的计算机之一。DEC 策略的基石是一个单一的体系结构，即 VAX，运行了一个罪恶的操作系统 VM。该策略运行良好已有 10 多年。大量报告指导的论文结合了 VAX 的实施测量和分析，使其成为理想的案例研究[Clark and Levy 1982;Wiecek 1982]。Bhandarkar 和 Clark [1991]对 VAX 与 RISC 计算机的缺点进行了定量分析，这实质上是对 VAX 消亡的技术解释。

While the VAX was being designed, a more radical approach, called _high-level language computer architecture_ (HLLCA), was being advocated in the research community. This movement aimed to eliminate the gap between high-level lan- guages and computer hardware—what Gagliardi [1973] called the “semantic gap”—by bringing the hardware “up to” the level of the programming language. Meyers [1982] provided a good summary of the arguments and a history of high- level language computer architecture projects. HLLCA never had a significant commercial impact. The increase in memory size on computers eliminated the code size problems arising from high-level languages and enabled operating systems to be written in high-level languages. The combination of simpler architectures together with software offered greater performance and more flexibility at lower cost and lower complexity.

> 在设计 VAX 的同时，研究界提倡了一种更激进的方法，称为_-High 级语言计算机架构_(HLLCA)。该运动旨在消除高级语言和计算机硬件之间的差距(Gagliardi [1973]称为“语义差距”)，通过将硬件“达到”编程语言的级别。Meyers [1982]提供了有关高级语言计算机体系结构项目的论点和历史的很好摘要。HLLCA 从未产生重大的商业影响。计算机上的内存大小的增加消除了由高级语言引起的代码大小问题，并使操作系统能够以高级语言编写。更简单的体系结构与软件的结合提供了更高的性能，并且以较低的成本和较低的复杂性提供了更大的灵活性。

### Reduced Instruction Set Computers

> ###减少指令集计算机

In the early 1980s, the direction of computer architecture began to swing away from providing high-level hardware support for languages. Ditzel and Patterson [1980] analyzed the difficulties encountered by the high-level language architectures and argued that the answer lay in simpler architectures. In another paper [Patterson and Ditzel 1980], these authors first discussed the idea of Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISCs) and presented the argument for simpler architectures. Clark and Strecker [1980], who were VAX architects, rebutted their proposal.

> 在 1980 年代初期，计算机架构的方向开始摆脱为语言提供高级硬件支持。Ditzel 和 Patterson [1980]分析了高级语言体系结构遇到的困难，并认为答案在于更简单的架构。在另一篇论文[Patterson and Ditzel 1980]中，这些作者首先讨论了减少指导集计算机(RISC)的想法，并提出了更简单的体系结构的论点。VAX 工程师的 Clark and Strecker [1980]驳回了他们的建议。

The simple load-store computers such as MIPS are commonly called RISC architectures. The roots of RISC architectures go back to computers like the 6600, where Thornton, Cray, and others recognized the importance of instruction set simplicity in building a fast computer. Cray continued his tradition of keeping computers simple in the CRAY-1. Commercial RISCs are built primarily on the work of three research projects: the Berkeley RISC processor, the IBM 801, and the Stanford MIPS processor. These architectures have attracted enormous industrial interest because of claims of a performance advantage of anywhere from two to five times over other computers using the same technology.

> 简单的负载商店(例如 MIPS)通常称为 RISC 架构。RISC 架构的根源可以追溯到 6600 等计算机，桑顿，克雷和其他人认识到教学设置简单性在构建快速计算机中的重要性。克雷继续他的传统，即在 Cray-1 中保持计算机简单。商业 RISC 主要建立在三个研究项目的工作：伯克利 RISC 处理器，IBM 801 和 Stanford MIPS 处理器。这些体系结构吸引了巨大的工业兴趣，因为使用相同技术比其他计算机具有两到五倍的性能优势。

Begun in 1975, the IBM project was the first to start but was the last to become public. The IBM computer was designed as a 24-bit ECL minicomputer, while the university projects were both MOS-based, 32-bit microprocessors. John Cocke is considered the father of the 801 design. He received both the Eckert–Mauchly and Turing awards in recognition of his contribution. Radin [1982] described the high- lights of the 801 architecture. The 801 was an experimental project that was never designed to be a product. In fact, to keep down costs and complexity, the computer was built with only 24-bit registers.

> IBM 项目始于 1975 年，是第一个开始的项目，但是最后一次公开的项目。IBM 计算机设计为 24 位 ECL 微型计算机，而大学项目都是基于 MOS 的 32 位微处理器。约翰·科克(John Cocke)被认为是 801 设计的父亲。他获得了埃克特(Eckert – Mauchly)和图灵(Turing)奖，以表彰他的贡献。Radin [1982]描述了 801 体系结构的高光。801 是一个从未被设计为产品的实验项目。实际上，为了降低成本和复杂性，计算机仅使用 24 位寄存器构建。

In 1980, Patterson and his colleagues at Berkeley began the project that was to give this architectural approach its name (see Patterson and Ditzel [1980]). They built two computers called RISC-I and RISC-II. Because the IBM project was not widely known or discussed, the role played by the Berkeley group in promoting the RISC approach was critical to acceptance of the technology. They also built one of the first instruction caches to support hybrid-format RISCs (see Patterson et al. [1983]). It supported 16-bit and 32-bit instructions in memory but 32 bits in the cache. The Berkeley group went on to build RISC computers targeted toward Smalltalk, described by Ungar et al. [1984], and LISP, described by Taylor et al. [1986].

> 1980 年，帕特森(Patterson)及其在伯克利(Berkeley)的同事开始了该项目，该项目是为了使这种建筑方法的名称(见 Patterson and Ditzel [1980])。他们建造了两台称为 RISC-I 和 RISC-II 的计算机。由于 IBM 项目并未广为人知或讨论，因此伯克利集团在促进 RISC 方法中所扮演的角色对于接受该技术至关重要。他们还建立了最早的指令缓存之一，以支持混合形式的 RISC(参见 Patterson 等人[1983])。它支持内存中的 16 位和 32 位指令，但缓存中有 32 位。伯克利集团继续建造针对 Smalltalk 的 RISC 计算机，由 Ungar 等人描述。[1984]和 LISP，由 Taylor 等人描述。[1986]。

In 1981, Hennessy and his colleagues at Stanford published a description of the Stanford MIPS computer. Efficient pipelining and compiler-assisted scheduling of the pipeline were both important aspects of the original MIPS design. MIPS stood for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages, reflecting the lack of hardware to stall the pipeline, as the compiler would handle dependencies.

> 1981 年，轩尼诗(Hennessy)和他在斯坦福大学(Stanford)的同事发表了斯坦福·麦普斯(Stanford Mips)计算机的描述。管道的有效管道和编译器辅助计划都是原始 MIPS 设计的重要方面。MIPS 代表微处理器没有互锁管道阶段，反映出缺乏使管道拖延的硬件，因为编译器会处理依赖项。

These early RISC computers—the 801, RISC-II, and MIPS—had much in common. Both university projects were interested in designing a simple computer that could be built in VLSI within the university environment. All three computers used a simple load-store architecture and fixed-format 32-bit instructions, and emphasized efficient pipelining. Patterson [1985] described the three computers and the basic design principles that have come to characterize what a RISC com- puter is, and Hennessy [1984] provided another view of the same ideas, as well as other issues in VLSI processor design.

> 这些早期的 RISC 计算机(801，RISC-II 和 MIPS)有很多共同点。这两个大学项目都有兴趣设计一台可以在大学环境中在 VLSI 中构建的简单计算机。所有三台计算机均使用简单的负载商店体系结构和固定格式 32 位指令，并强调有效的管道。Patterson [1985]描述了三台计算机和基本的设计原则，这些原则已经描述了 RISC 计算机的含义，而 Hennessy [1984]提供了相同想法的另一种观点，以及 VLSI 处理器设计中的其他问题。

In 1985, Hennessy published an explanation of the RISC performance advan- tage and traced its roots to a substantially lower CPI—under 2 for a RISC processor and over 10 for a VAX-11/780 (though not with identical workloads). A paper by Emer and Clark [1984] characterizing VAX-11/780 performance was instrumental in helping the RISC researchers understand the source of the performance advan- tage seen by their computers.

> 1985 年，轩尼诗(Hennessy)发表了对 RISC 绩效的解释，并将其根源追溯到 CPI 较低的 CPI，在 RISC 处理器中为 2，而 VAX-11/780 的含量超过 10(尽管没有相同的工作量)。Emer 和 Clark [1984]的一篇论文表征了 VAX-11/780 的性能，在帮助 RISC 研究人员了解其计算机所看到的性能的来源方面起了重要作用。

Since the university projects finished up, in the 1983–1984 time frame, the technology has been widely embraced by industry. Many manufacturers of the early computers (those made before 1986) claimed that their products were RISC computers. These claims, however, were often born more of marketing ambition than of engineering reality.

> 自从大学项目完成以来，在 1983  -  1984 年的时间范围内，该技术已被行业广泛接受。早期计算机的许多制造商(1986 年之前制造)声称他们的产品是 RISC 计算机。但是，这些主张通常比工程现实更多地诞生了营销野心。

In 1986, the computer industry began to announce processors based on the tech- nology explored by the three RISC research projects. Moussouris et al. [1986] described the MIPS R2000 integer processor, while Kane’s book [1986] provides a complete description of the architecture. Hewlett-Packard converted their existing minicomputer line to RISC architectures; Lee [1989] described the HP Precision Architecture. IBM never directly turned the 801 into a product. Instead, the ideas were adopted for a new, low-end architecture that was incorporated in the IBM RT-PC and described in a collection of papers [Waters 1986]. In 1990, IBM announced a new RISC architecture (the RS 6000), which is the first superscalar RISC processor. In 1987, Sun Microsystems began delivering computers based on the SPARC architecture, a derivative of the Berkeley RISC-II processor; SPARC is described in Garner et al. [1988]. The PowerPC joined the forces of Apple, IBM, and Motorola. Appendix K summarizes several RISC architectures.

> 1986 年，计算机行业开始根据三个 RISC 研究项目探索的技术宣布处理器。Moussouris 等。[1986]描述了 MIPS R2000 Integer 处理器，而 Kane 的书[1986]提供了对体系结构的完整描述。惠普(Hewlett-Packard)将现有的微型计算机系列转换为 RISC 架构；Lee [1989]描述了 HP 精密体系结构。IBM 从未将 801 直接变成产品。取而代之的是，这些想法是针对 IBM RT-PC 中纳入的一种新的低端体系结构采用的，并在一系列论文中进行了描述[Waters 1986]。1990 年，IBM 宣布了新的 RISC 建筑(6000 卢比)，这是第一个 SuperScalar RISC 处理器。1987 年，Sun Microsystems 开始基于 SPARC 体系结构(Berkeley RISC II 处理器的衍生物)提供计算机。Garner 等人描述了 SPARC。[1988]。PowerPC 加入了苹果，IBM 和摩托罗拉的力量。附录 K 总结了几个 RISC 架构。

To help resolve the RISC versus traditional design debate, designers of VAX processors later performed a quantitative comparison of VAX and a RISC proces- sor for implementations with comparable organizations. Their choices were the

> 为了帮助解决 RISC 与传统的设计辩论，VAX 处理器的设计师随后对 VAX 和 RISC PROCESS 进行了定量比较，用于与可比组织的实施。他们的选择是

VAX 8700 and the MIPS M2000. The differing goals for VAX and MIPS have led to very different architectures. The VAX goals, simple compilers and code density, led to powerful addressing modes, powerful instructions, efficient instruction encoding, and few registers. The MIPS goals were high performance via pipelin- ing, ease of hardware implementation, and compatibility with highly optimizing compilers. These goals led to simple instructions, simple addressing modes, fixed-length instruction formats, and a large number of registers.

> VAX 8700 和 MIPS M2000。VAX 和 MIP 的不同目标导致了截然不同的架构。VAX 目标，简单的编译器和代码密度，导致了强大的寻址模式，强大的说明，有效的指令编码以及很少的寄存器。MIPS 目标是通过管道登录，易于实现硬件以及与高度优化编译器的兼容性的高性能。这些目标导致简单的说明，简单的寻址模式，固定长度指令格式以及大量寄存器。

[Figure M.1](#_bookmark908) shows the ratio of the number of instructions executed, the ratio of CPIs, and the ratio of performance measured in clock cycles. Since the organiza- tions were similar, clock cycle times were assumed to be the same. MIPS executes about twice as many instructions as the VAX, while the CPI for the VAX is about six times larger than that for the MIPS. Hence, the MIPS M2000 has almost three times the performance of the VAX 8700. Furthermore, much less hardware is needed to build the MIPS processor than the VAX processor. This cost- performance gap is the reason why the company that used to make the VAX intro- duced a MIPS-based product and then has dropped the VAX completely and switched to Alpha, which is quite similar to MIPS. Bell and Strecker [1998] summarized the debate inside the company. Today, DEC, once the second largest computer company and the major success of the minicomputer industry, exists only as remnants within HP and Intel.

> [图 M.1](#_ bookmark908)显示了执行指令数，CPI 的比率以及以时钟周期测量的性能之比。由于组织相似，因此时钟周期时间被认为是相同的。MIPS 执行的指令大约是 VAX 的两倍，而 VAX 的 CPI 大约是 MIP 的六倍。因此，MIPS M2000 的性能几乎是 VAX 8700 的性能。此外，构建 MIPS 处理器所需的硬件要比 VAX 处理器所需的硬件要少得多。这种成本 - 性能差距是用来使 VAX 引入基于 MIPS 的产品的公司的原因，然后完全放弃了 VAX 并切换到 Alpha，这与 MIPS 非常相似。Bell and Strecker [1998]总结了公司内部的辩论。今天，12 月，曾经是第二大计算机公司，也是微型计算机行业的主要成功，仅作为 HP 和 Intel 内的残留物而存在。

Figure M.1 Ratio of MIPS M2000 to VAX 8700 in instructions executed and performance in clock cycles using SPEC89 programs. On average, MIPS executes a little over twice as many instructions as the VAX, but the CPI for the VAX is almost six times the MIPS CPI, yielding almost a threefold performance advantage. (Based on data from Bhandarkar and Clark [1991].)

> 图 M.1 使用 SPEC89 程序在执行时钟周期中执行的指令中 MIPS M2000 与 VAX 8700 的比率。平均而言，MIP 执行的指令是 VAX 的两倍以上，但 VAX 的 CPI 几乎是 MIPS CPI 的六倍，几乎具有三倍的性能优势。(基于 Bhandarkar 和 Clark [1991]的数据。

Looking back, only one Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) instruction set survived the RISC/CISC debate, and that one had binary compatibility with PC software. The volume of chips is so high in the PC industry that there is a sufficient revenue stream to pay the extra design costs—and sufficient resources due to Moore’s law—to build microprocessors that translate from CISC to RISC inter- nally. Whatever loss in efficiency occurred (due to longer pipeline stages and big- ger die size to accommodate translation on the chip) was overcome by the enormous volume and the ability to dedicate IC processing lines specifically to this product.

> 回顾过去，只有一台复杂的指令集计算机(CISC)指令集在 RISC/CISC 辩论中幸存下来，并且与 PC 软件具有二进制兼容性。PC 行业的芯片数量很高，以至于有足够的收入来源支付额外的设计成本以及由于摩尔定律而产生的足够资源，以构建从 CISC 转换为 RISC 的微处理器。无论发生效率的损失(由于管道阶段较长和大小的大小，以适应芯片上的翻译)都可以通过巨大的体积和专门针对该产品的 IC 加工线的能力来克服。

Interestingly, Intel also concluded that the future of the 80x86 line was doubt- ful. They created the IA-64 architecture to support 64-bit addressing and to move to a RISC-style instruction set. The embodiment of the IA-64 (see Huck et al. [2000]) architecture in the Itanium-1 and Itanium-2 has been a mixed suc- cess. Although high performance has been achieved for floating-point applica- tions, the integer performance was never impressive. In addition, the Itanium implementations have been large in transistor count and die size and power hungry. The complexity of the IA-64 instruction set, standing at least in partial conflict with the RISC philosophy, no doubt contributed to this area and power inefficiency.

> 有趣的是，英特尔还得出结论，80x86 线的未来是怀疑的。他们创建了 IA-64 体系结构，以支持 64 位地址并转移到 RISC 风格的指令集。IA-64 的实施例(参见 Huck 等人[2000])在 Itanium-1 和 Itanium-2 中的结构是混合的成功。尽管为浮点应用实现了高性能，但整数性能从未令人印象深刻。此外，晶体管计数和模具尺寸和饥饿的动力也很大。IA-64 指令集的复杂性至少与 RISC 哲学的部分冲突，毫无疑问，这一领域和力量效率低下。

AMD decided instead to just stretch the architecture from a 32-bit address to a 64-bit address, much as Intel had done when the 80386 stretched it from a 16-bit address to a 32-bit address. Intel later followed AMD’s example. In the end, the tremendous marketplace advantage of the 80x86 presence was too much even for Intel, the owner of this legacy, to overcome!

> 相反，AMD 决定将建筑从 32 位地址扩展到 64 位地址，就像英特尔 80386 将其从 16 位地址扩展到 32 位地址时所做的那样。英特尔后来遵循 AMD 的榜样。最后，即使对于这位遗产的所有者英特尔而言，80x86 存在的巨大市场优势也无法克服！
