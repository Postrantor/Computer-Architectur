## Concluding Remarks

> ##总结

_Storage is one of those technologies that we tend to take for granted. And yet, if we look at the true status of things today, storage is king. One can even argue that servers, which have become commodities, are now becoming peripheral to storage devices. Driving that point home are some estimates from IBM, which expects storage sales to surpass server sales in the next two years._

> _storage 是我们倾向于理所当然的技术之一。然而，如果我们看一下今天的真实地位，存储就是国王。甚至可以说已经成为商品的服务器现在正成为存储设备的外围。驾驶该点的房屋是 IBM 的一些估计，该估计预计存储销售将在未来两年内超过服务器销售。

The challenges for storage systems today are dependability and maintainabil- ity. Not only do users want to be sure their data are never lost (reliability), applications today increasingly demand that the data are always available to access (availability). Despite improvements in hardware and software reliability and fault tolerance, the awkwardness of maintaining such systems is a problem both for cost and for availability. A widely mentioned statistic is that customers spend $6 to $8 operating a storage system for every $1 of purchase price. When dependability is attacked by having many redundant copies at a higher level of the system—such as for search—then very large systems can be sensitive to the price-performance of the storage components.

> 当今存储系统的挑战是可靠性和维护性。用户不仅希望确保其数据永远不会丢失（可靠性），因此当今的应用程序越来越多地要求数据始终可访问（可用性）。尽管硬件和软件的可靠性和容错性有所提高，但维护此类系统的尴尬既是成本和可用性的问题。一个广泛提及的统计数据是，客户每 $ 1 的购买价格都花费 6 到 8 美元，运营存储系统。当可靠性通过在系统的较高级别（例如搜索）中使用许多冗余副本而受到攻击，那么非常大的系统可能会对存储组件的价格绩效敏感。

Today, challenges in storage dependability and maintainability dominate the challenges of I/O.
