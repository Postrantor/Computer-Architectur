## Concluding Remarks

As we saw in the previous section, multicore does not magically solve the power problem because it clearly increases both the transistor count and the active number of transistors switching, which are the two dominant contributions to power. The failure of Dennard scaling merely makes it more extreme.

> 正如我们在上一节中看到的那样，Multicore 并不能神奇地解决功率问题，因为它清楚地增加了晶体管计数和晶体管切换的主动数，这是对功率的两个主要贡献。丹纳德缩放的失败仅使其更加极端。

But multicore does alter the game. By allowing idle cores to be placed in power-saving mode, some improvement in power efficiency can be achieved, as the results in this chapter have shown. For example, shutting down cores in the Intel i7 allows other cores to operate in Turbo mode. This capability allows a trade-off between higher clock rates with fewer processors and more processors with lower clock rates.

> 但是 Multicore 确实改变了游戏。通过允许将空闲芯放置在节能模式下，可以提高功率效率，如本章所示。例如，关闭英特尔 i7 中的内核允许其他内核在涡轮模式下运行。这种功能允许在更高的处理器和更低时钟速率的处理器更少的处理器和更多的处理器之间进行权衡。

More importantly, multicore shifts the burden for keeping the processor busy by relying more on TLP, which the application and programmer are responsible for identifying, rather than on ILP, for which the hardware is responsible. Multiprogrammed and highly parallel workloads that avoid Amdahl’s Law effects will benefit more easily.

> 更重要的是，多核算通过更多地依靠 TLP 来改变处理器的负担，该责任是应用程序和程序员负责识别硬件负责的 ILP 而不是 ILP 的负担。避免 AMDAHL 定律效应的多编程和高度平行的工作负载将更容易受益。

Although multicore provides some help with the energy efficiency challenge and shifts much of the burden to the software system, there remain difficult challenges and unresolved questions. For example, attempts to exploit thread-level versions of aggressive speculation have so far met the same fate as their ILP counterparts. That is, the performance gains have been modest and are likely less than the increase in energy consumption, so ideas such as speculative threads or hardware run-ahead have not been successfully incorporated in processors. As in speculation for ILP, unless the speculation is almost always right, the costs exceed the benefits.

> 尽管 Multicore 在能源效率挑战方面提供了一些帮助，并将大部分负担转移到了软件系统上，但仍存在困难的挑战和未解决的问题。例如，试图利用激进投机的线程级版本已经达到了与他们的 ILP 对应物相同的命运。也就是说，性能增长是适度的，可能小于能源消耗的增加，因此，投机线程或硬件跑步等想法尚未成功地纳入处理器中。就像对 ILP 的投机性一样，除非投机几乎总是正确的，否则费用超过了收益。

Thus, at the present, it seems unlikely that some form of simple multicore scaling will provide a cost-effective path to growing performance. A fundamental problem must be overcome: finding and exploiting significant amounts of parallelism in an energyand silicon-efficient manner. In the previous chapter, we examined the exploitation of data parallelism via a SIMD approach. In many applications, data parallelism occurs in large amounts, and SIMD is a more energyefficient method for exploiting data parallelism. In the next chapter, we explore large-scale cloud computing. In such environments, massive amounts of parallelism are available from millions of independent tasks generated by individual users. Amdahl’s Law plays little role in limiting the scale of such systems because the tasks (e.g., millions of Google search requests) are independent. Finally, in [Chapter 7](#_bookmark322), we explore the rise of domain-specific architectures (DSAs). Most domain-specific architectures exploit the parallelism of the targeted domain, which is often data parallelism, and as with GPUs, DSAs can achieve much higher efficiency as measured by energy consumption or silicon utilization.

> 因此，目前，某种形式的简单多项缩放似乎不太可能为增长的性能提供成本效益的途径。必须克服一个基本问题：以能量和硅有效的方式查找和利用大量的并行性。在上一章中，我们通过 SIMD 方法检查了数据并行性的开发。在许多应用中，数据并行性大量发生，而 SIMD 是利用数据并行性的更节能的方法。在下一章中，我们将探索大规模的云计算。在这样的环境中，可以从个人用户生成的数百万个独立任务中获得大量的并行性。Amdahl 的定律在限制此类系统的规模中发挥作用，因为任务(例如，数以百万计的 Google 搜索请求)是独立的。最后，在[第 7 章](#_bookmark322)中，我们探索了特定于域的体系结构(DSA)的崛起。大多数特定领域的体系结构利用了靶向域的并行性，该域通常是数据并行性，与 GPU 一样，DSA 可以实现更高的效率，如能源消耗或硅利用率所测量。

In the last edition, published in 2012, we raised the question of whether it would be worthwhile to consider heterogeneous processors. At that time, no such multicore was delivered or announced, and heterogeneous multiprocessors had seen only limited success in special-purpose computers or embedded systems. While the programming models and software systems remain challenging, it appears inevitable that multiprocessors with heterogeneous processors will play an important role. Combining domain-specific processors, like those discussed in Chapters [4](#_bookmark165) and [7](#_bookmark322), with general-purpose processors is perhaps the best road forward to achieve increased performance and energy efficiency while maintaining some of the flexibility that general-purpose processors offer.

> 在 2012 年出版的上一版中，我们提出了一个问题，即是否值得考虑异质处理器。当时，没有交付或宣布此类多核物，异质的多处理器在专用计算机或嵌入式系统中仅能有限的成功。虽然编程模型和软件系统仍然具有挑战性，但似乎不可避免的是具有异质处理器的多处理器将发挥重要作用。将特定于领域的处理器组合在一起，例如 [4](#_bookmark165) 和 [7](#_bookmark322) 中讨论的处理器，以及通用处理器，也许是提高性能和能源效率的最佳前进道路通用处理器提供的灵活性。
