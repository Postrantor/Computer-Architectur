## Hardware Support for Exposing Parallelism: Predicated Instructions

Techniques such as loop unrolling, software pipelining, and trace scheduling can be used to increase the amount of parallelism available when the behavior of branches is fairly predictable at compile time. When the behavior of branches is not well known, compiler techniques alone may not be able to uncover much ILP. In such cases, the control dependences may severely limit the amount of par- allelism that can be exploited. To overcome these problems, an architect can extend the instruction set to include _conditional_ or _predicated instructions_. Such instruc- tions can be used to eliminate branches, converting a control dependence into a data dependence and potentially improving performance. Such approaches are use- ful with either the hardware-intensive schemes in [Chapter 3](#_bookmark93) or the software- intensive approaches discussed in this appendix, since in both cases predication can be used to eliminate branches.

> 当分支的行为在编译时相当可预测时，可以使用循环展开、软件流水线和跟踪调度等技术来增加可用的并行度。当分支的行为不为人所知时，单靠编译器技术可能无法发现很多 ILP。在这种情况下，控制依赖性可能会严重限制可以利用的并行性的数量。为了克服这些问题，架构师可以扩展指令集以包含*条件*或*谓词指令*。此类指令可用于消除分支，将控制依赖性转换为数据依赖性并可能提高性能。这种方法对于 [第 3 章](#_bookmark93) 中的硬件密集型方案或本附录中讨论的软件密集型方案都很有用，因为在这两种情况下都可以使用谓词来消除分支。

The concept behind conditional instructions is quite simple: An instruction refers to a condition, which is evaluated as part of the instruction execution. If the condition is true, the instruction is executed normally; if the condition is false, the execution continues as if the instruction were a no-op. Many newer architec- tures include some form of conditional instructions. The most common example of such an instruction is conditional move, which moves a value from one register to another if the condition is true. Such an instruction can be used to completely elim- inate a branch in simple code sequences.

> 条件指令背后的概念非常简单：一条指令指的是一个条件，它被评估为指令执行的一部分。如果条件为真，则指令正常执行；如果条件为假，则继续执行，就好像该指令是空操作一样。许多较新的体系结构包括某种形式的条件指令。这种指令的最常见示例是条件移动，如果条件为真，它将值从一个寄存器移动到另一个寄存器。这样的指令可用于完全消除简单代码序列中的分支。

Example Consider the following code:

Assuming that registers R1, R2, and R3 hold the values of A, S, and T, respec- tively, show the code for this statement with the branch and with the conditional move.

> 假设寄存器 R1，R2 和 R3 具有 A，S 和 T 的值，则可以通过分支和条件移动显示此语句的代码。

_Answer_ The straightforward code using a branch for this statement is (remember that we are assuming normal rather than delayed branches)

> *answer* 使用该语句的分支的直接代码是(请记住，我们假设正常而不是延迟分支)

Using a conditional move that performs the move only if the third operand is equal to zero, we can implement this statement in one instruction:

> 只有在第三操作数等于零的情况下，使用有条件执行移动的有条件移动，我们可以在一项指令中实现此语句：

The conditional instruction allows us to convert the control dependence present in the branch-based code sequence to a data dependence. (This transformation is also used for vector computers, where it is called _if conversion_.) For a pipelined pro- cessor, this moves the place where the dependence must be resolved from near the front of the pipeline, where it is resolved for branches, to the end of the pipeline, where the register write occurs.

> 条件指令使我们能够将基于分支代码序列中存在的控制依赖性转换为数据依赖性。(此转换也用于矢量计算机，其中称为*if conversion *。)对于管道上的专门，这移动了必须从管道的前部附近解析依赖性的地方，该位置已解决该分支机构，以解决分支机构，分支机构。到管道的末端，发生寄存器写入的地方。

One obvious use for conditional move is to implement the absolute value function: A = abs (B), which is implemented as if (B<0) {A=-B;} else {A=B;}. This if statement can be implemented as a pair of conditional moves, or as one unconditional move (A=B) and one conditional move (A=-B).

> 有条件移动的一种明显用途是实现绝对值函数：a = abs(b)，它可以像(b <0){a = -b;} else {a = b;}实现。如果语句可以作为条件移动或一个无条件移动(a = b)和一个条件移动(a = -b)实现。

In the example above or in the compilation of absolute value, conditional moves are used to change a control dependence into a data dependence. This enables us to eliminate the branch and possibly improve the pipeline behavior. As issue rates increase, designers are faced with one of two choices: execute multiple branches per clock cycle or find a method to eliminate branches to avoid this requirement. Handling multiple branches per clock is complex, since one branch must be control dependent on the other. The difficulty of accurately predicting two branch outcomes, updating the prediction tables, and executing the correct sequence has so far caused most designers to avoid processors that execute multiple branches per clock. Conditional moves and predicated instruc- tions provide a way of reducing the branch pressure. In addition, a conditional move can often eliminate a branch that is hard to predict, increasing the potential gain.

> 在上面的示例或绝对值的汇编中，有条件移动用于将控制依赖性更改为数据依赖性。这使我们能够消除分支机构并可能改善管道行为。随着发行率的增加，设计师面临两个选择之一：每个时钟周期执行多个分支，或找到消除分支以避免此要求的方法。每个时钟处理多个分支很复杂，因为一个分支必须控制另一个分支。到目前为止，准确预测两个分支结果，更新预测表并执行正确的序列的困难使大多数设计师避免了每个时钟执行多个分支的处理器。有条件的移动和预测的指标提供了一种降低分支压力的方法。此外，有条件的移动通常可以消除难以预测的分支，从而增加潜在的增益。

Conditional moves are the simplest form of conditional or predicated instructions and, although useful for short sequences, have limitations. In par- ticular, using conditional move to eliminate branches that guard the execution of large blocks of code can be inefficient, since many conditional moves may need to be introduced.

> 条件移动是条件或预性指令的最简单形式，尽管对短序列有用，但具有局限性。在特定的情况下，使用条件移动来消除保护大块代码的执行的分支可能是效率低下的，因为可能需要引入许多条件移动。

To remedy the inefficiency of using conditional moves, some architectures support full predication, whereby the execution of all instructions is controlled by a predicate. When the predicate is false, the instruction becomes a no-op. Full predication allows us to simply convert large blocks of code that are branch depen- dent. For example, an if-then-else statement within a loop can be entirely converted to predicated execution, so that the code in the then case executes only if the value of the condition is true and the code in the else case executes only if the value of the condition is false. Predication is particularly valuable with global code scheduling, since it can eliminate nonloop branches, which significantly complicate instruction scheduling.

> 为了弥补使用条件移动的低效率，一些体系结构支持完全谓词，从而所有指令的执行都由谓词控制。当谓词为假时，指令变为空操作。完全谓词允许我们简单地转换大块的分支相关代码。例如，循环中的 if-then-else 语句可以完全转换为谓词执行，这样 then case 中的代码只有在条件为真时才执行，else case 中的代码只有在条件为真时才执行 条件的值为假。预测对于全局代码调度特别有价值，因为它可以消除非循环分支，这会大大复杂化指令调度。

Predicated instructions can also be used to speculatively move an instruction that is time critical, but may cause an exception if moved before a guarding branch. Although it is possible to do this with conditional move, it is more costly.

> 预测的说明也可以用于投机移动至关重要的指令，但如果在守卫分支之前移动，可能会引起例外。尽管可以通过有条件的举动进行此操作，但价格更高。

Example Here is a code sequence for a two-issue superscalar that can issue a combination of one memory reference and one ALU operation, or a branch by itself, every cycle:

> 示例此处是两个问题超级标准的代码序列，该序列可以发出一个内存参考和一个 ALU 操作的组合或每个周期的分支：

This sequence wastes a memory operation slot in the second cycle and will incur a data dependence stall if the branch is not taken, since the second LW after the branch depends on the prior load. Show how the code can be improved using a predicated form of LW.

> 该序列在第二个周期中浪费了一个存储器操作插槽，如果不进行分支，则会产生数据依赖性失速，因为分支后的第二个 LW 取决于先前的负载。展示如何使用 LW 的谓词形式改进代码。

_Answer_ Call the predicated version load word LWC and assume the load occurs unless the third operand is 0. The LW immediately following the branch can be converted to an LWC and moved up to the second issue slot:

> *answer* 调用谓词版本加载字 LWC，并假设负载发生，除非第三操作数为 0。

This improves the execution time by several cycles since it eliminates one instruc- tion issue slot and reduces the pipeline stall for the last instruction in the sequence. Of course, if the compiler mispredicted the branch, the predicated instruction will have no effect and will not improve the running time. This is why the transforma- tion is speculative.

> 这可以通过几个周期提高执行时间，因为它消除了一个指导问题插槽，并减少了序列中最后一个指令的管道摊位。当然，如果编译器对分支机构进行了错误预测，则预测指令将无效，也不会改善运行时间。这就是为什么转换具有投机性的原因。

If the sequence following the branch were short, the entire block of code might be converted to predicated execution and the branch eliminated.

> 如果分支之后的序列短，则可以将整个代码块转换为谓词执行，并消除分支。

When we convert an entire code segment to predicated execution or specula- tively move an instruction and make it predicted, we remove a control dependence. Correct code generation and the conditional execution of predicated instructions ensure that we maintain the data flow enforced by the branch. To ensure that the exception behavior is also maintained, a predicated instruction must not gen- erate an exception if the predicate is false. The property of not causing exceptions is quite critical, as the previous example shows: If register R10 contains zero, the instruction LW R8,0(R10) executed unconditionally is likely to cause a protec- tion exception, and this exception should not occur. Of course, if the condition is satisfied (i.e., R10 is not zero), the LW may still cause a legal and resumable excep- tion (e.g., a page fault), and the hardware must take the exception when it knows that the controlling condition is true.

> 当我们将整个代码段转换为谓词执行或推测性地移动一条指令并使其被预测时，我们就消除了控制依赖性。正确的代码生成和谓词指令的条件执行确保我们维护分支强制执行的数据流。为确保异常行为也得以维持，断言指令在断言为假时不得产生异常。不引发异常的特性非常关键，如前面的示例所示：如果寄存器 R10 包含零，则无条件执行的指令 LW R8,0(R10) 很可能引发保护异常，而该异常不应发生。当然，如果满足条件(即 R10 不为零)，LW 仍可能导致合法且可恢复的异常(例如页面错误)，并且硬件必须在知道控制 条件为真。

The major complication in implementing predicated instructions is deciding when to annul an instruction. Predicated instructions may either be annulled during instruction issue or later in the pipeline before they commit any results or raise an exception. Each choice has a disadvantage. If predicated instructions are annulled early in the pipeline, the value of the controlling condition must be known early to prevent a stall for a data hazard. Since data-dependent branch conditions, which tend to be less predictable, are candidates for conversion to predicated execution, this choice can lead to more pipeline stalls. Because of this potential for data hazard stalls, no design with predicated execution (or conditional move) annuls instruc- tions early. Instead, all existing processors annul instructions later in the pipeline, which means that annulled instructions will consume functional unit resources and potentially have a negative impact on performance. A variety of other pipeline implementation techniques, such as forwarding, interact with predicated instruc- tions, further complicating the implementation.

> 实现谓词指令的主要复杂性是决定何时取消一条指令。谓词指令可以在指令发出期间被取消，也可以在它们提交任何结果或引发异常之前在流水线中被取消。每个选择都有一个缺点。如果谓词指令在流水线的早期被取消，则必须尽早知道控制条件的值以防止因数据冒险而停止。由于依赖于数据的分支条件往往更难预测，因此是转换为预测执行的候选条件，因此这种选择可能会导致更多的流水线停顿。由于这种潜在的数据风险停顿，没有预测执行(或条件移动)的设计会提前取消指令。相反，所有现有的处理器都会在流水线的后面取消指令，这意味着取消的指令将消耗功能单元资源并可能对性能产生负面影响。各种其他管道实现技术，例如转发，与谓词指令交互，进一步使实现复杂化。

Predicated or conditional instructions are extremely useful for implementing short alternative control flows, for eliminating some unpredictable branches, and for reducing the overhead of global code scheduling. Nonetheless, the useful- ness of conditional instructions is limited by several factors:

> 预测或条件指令对于实施简短的替代控制流，消除一些不可预测的分支以及减少全球代码调度的开销非常有用。但是，条件指示的有用限制受到几个因素：

- Predicated instructions that are annulled (i.e., whose conditions are false) still take some processor resources. An annulled predicated instruction requires fetch resources at a minimum, and in most processors functional unit execution time. Therefore, moving an instruction across a branch and making it condi- tional will slow the program down whenever the moved instruction would not have been normally executed. Likewise, predicating a control-dependent portion of code and eliminating a branch may slow down the processor if that code would not have been executed. An important exception to these situations occurs when the cycles used by the moved instruction when it is not performed would have been idle anyway (as in the earlier superscalar example). Moving an instruction across a branch or converting a code segment to predicated exe- cution is essentially speculating on the outcome of the branch. Conditional instructions make this easier but do not eliminate the execution time taken by an incorrect guess. In simple cases, where we trade a conditional move for a branch and a move, using conditional moves or predication is almost always better. When longer code sequences are made conditional, the benefits are more limited.

> - 被取消的谓词指令(即，其条件为假)仍然占用一些处理器资源。一个无效的谓词指令至少需要获取资源，并且在大多数处理器中需要功能单元执行时间。因此，只要移动的指令不会正常执行，将一条指令移动到一个分支上并使其成为条件指令就会减慢程序的速度。同样，断言代码的控制相关部分并消除分支可能会降低处理器的速度，如果该代码不会被执行的话。这些情况的一个重要例外是当被移动的指令在未执行时使用的周期无论如何都处于空闲状态(如在较早的超标量示例中)。跨分支移动指令或将代码段转换为谓词执行本质上是在推测分支的结果。条件指令使这更容易，但不会消除错误猜测所花费的执行时间。在简单的情况下，我们将条件移动换成分支和移动，使用条件移动或预测几乎总是更好。当较长的代码序列成为条件时，好处会更加有限。

- Predicated instructions are most useful when the predicate can be evaluated early. If the condition evaluation and predicated instructions cannot be separated (because of data dependences in determining the condition), then a conditional instruction may result in a stall for a data hazard. With branch pre- diction and speculation, such stalls can be avoided, at least when the branches are predicted accurately.

> - 当可以提早评估谓词时，谓词指令最有用。如果条件评估和预测指令无法分离(由于确定条件的数据依赖)，则有条件的指令可能会导致数据危害的失速。使用分支的词典和投机，至少在准确预测分支时，可以避免这种失速。

- The use of conditional instructions can be limited when the control flow involves more than a simple alternative sequence. For example, moving an instruction across multiple branches requires making it conditional on both branches, which requires two conditions to be specified or requires additional instructions to compute the controlling predicate. If such capabilities are not present, the overhead of if conversion will be larger, reducing its advantage.

> - 当对照流程涉及的不仅仅是简单的替代序列时，有条件指令的使用可能会受到限制。例如，在多个分支上移动指令需要在两个分支上进行有条件的条件，这需要指定两个条件或需要其他说明来计算控制谓词。如果不存在此类功能，则 IF 转换的开销将更大，从而降低其优势。

- Conditional instructions may have some speed penalty compared with uncon- ditional instructions. This may show up as a higher cycle count for such instructions or a slower clock rate overall. If conditional instructions are more expensive, they will need to be used judiciously.

> - 与不同意的说明相比，有条件的说明可能会受到一定的速度罚款。对于此类说明或总体时钟速率较慢，这可能显示为较高的周期计数。如果有条件的说明更昂贵，则需要明智地使用它们。

For these reasons, many architectures have included a few simple conditional instructions (with conditional move being the most frequent), but only a few archi- tectures include conditional versions for the majority of the instructions. The MIPS, Alpha, PowerPC, SPARC, and Intel x86 (as defined in the Pentium proces- sor) all support conditional move. The IA-64 architecture supports full predication for all instructions, as we will see in [Section H.6](#the-intel-ia-64-architecture-and-itanium-processor).

> 由于这些原因，许多架构都包含了一些简单的条件说明(有条件的移动是最常见的)，但是只有少数档案包括大多数说明的条件版本。MIPS，Alpha，PowerPC，SPARC 和 Intel X86(如 Pentium processor 中所定义)都支持条件移动。正如我们将在[H.6 节](＃The-Intel-ia-64-64-Architecture and-Itanium Processor)中看到的所有指令的完整预测。
