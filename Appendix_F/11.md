## Concluding Remarks

> ##总结

Interconnection network design is one of the most exciting areas of computer archi- tecture development today. With the advent of new multicore processor paradigms and advances in traditional multiprocessor/cluster systems and the Internet, many challenges and opportunities exist for interconnect architecture innovation. These apply to all levels of computer systems: communication between cores on a chip, between chips on a board, between boards in a system, and between computers in a machine room, over a local area and across the globe. Irrespective of their domain of application, interconnection networks should transfer the maximum amount of information within the least amount of time for given cost and power constraints so as not to bottleneck the system. Topology, routing, arbitration, switching, and flow control are among some of the key concepts in realizing such high-performance designs.

> 互连网络设计是当今计算机档案开发中最令人兴奋的领域之一。随着传统多处理器/群集系统和互联网的新型多核处理器范式的出现以及互连建筑创新的许多挑战和机遇。这些适用于所有级别的计算机系统：芯片上的核心之间的通信，木板上的芯片之间，系统中的板之间以及机械室中的计算机之间的计算机之间的通信。无论其应用领域如何，互连网络都应在给定的成本和功率约束的最短时间内传输最大信息量，以免瓶颈瓶颈。拓扑，路由，仲裁，开关和流量控制是实现此类高性能设计的一些关键概念。

The design of interconnection networks is end-to-end: It includes injection links, reception links, and the interfaces at network end points as much as it does the topology, switches, and links within the network fabric. It is often the case that the bandwidth and overhead at the end node interfaces are the bottleneck, yet many mistakenly think of the interconnection network to mean only the network fabric. This is as bad as processor designers thinking of com- puter architecture to mean only the instruction set architecture or only the microarchitecture! End-to-end issues and understanding of the traffic charac- teristics make the design of interconnection networks challenging and very much relevant even today. For instance, the need for low end-to-end latency is driving the development of efficient network interfaces located closer to the processor/memory controller. We may soon see most multicore processors used in multiprocessor systems implementing network interfaces on-chip, devoting some core(s) to execute communication tasks. This is already the case for the IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer, which uses one of its two cores on each processor chip for this purpose.

> 互连网络的设计是端到端的：它包括注入链接，接收链路和网络终点的接口，就像它在网络结构中使用的拓扑，开关和链接一样多。通常情况下，末端节点接口处的带宽和开销是瓶颈，但是许多人错误地认为互连网络仅表示网络结构。这与处理器设计师对 Compoter Architecture 的思考一样糟糕，仅表示指令集体系结构或仅是微观结构！端到端的问题和对交通特征的理解使互连网络的设计具有挑战性，即使在今天也非常相关。例如，对低端到端延迟的需求正在推动更靠近处理器/内存控制器的有效网络接口的开发。我们可能很快就会看到大多数多功能处理器在片上实现网络接口的多处理器系统中使用，专门用于执行通信任务。IBM 蓝色基因/L 超级计算机已经是这种情况，它为此目的使用了每个处理器芯片上的两个内核之一。

Networking has a long way to go from its humble shared-media beginnings. It is in “catch-up” mode, with switched-media point-to-point networks only recently displacing traditional bus-based networks in many networking domains, including on chip, I/O, and the local area. We are not near any performance plateaus, so we expect rapid advancement of WANs, LANs, SANs, and especially OCNs in the near future. Greater interconnection network performance is key to the information- and communication-centric vision of the future of our field, which, so far, has benefited many millions of people around the world in various ways. As the quotes at the beginning of this appendix suggest, this revolution in _two- way_ communication is at the heart of changes in the form of our human associa- tions and actions.

> 网络从其谦虚的共享媒体开始有很长的路要走。它处于“赶上”模式，切换的媒体点对点网络直到最近才在许多网络域中取代传统的基于巴士的网络，包括 ON 芯片，I/O 和本地区域。我们没有任何性能高原，因此我们预计在不久的将来，WAN，LAN，SANS，尤其是 OCN 的迅速发展。更大的互连网络性能是我们领域未来信息和以沟通为中心的愿景的关键，到目前为止，这已经以各种方式使世界上数百万人受益。正如本附录开头的报价所暗示的那样，_two_-Way\_交流中的这一革命是我们人类关联和行动形式的变化的核心。
