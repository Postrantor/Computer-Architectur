## Concluding Remarks

> ##总结

The earliest architectures were limited in their instruction sets by the hardware technology of that time. As soon as the hardware technology permitted, computer architects began looking for ways to support high-level languages. This search led to three distinct periods of thought about how to support programs efficiently. In the 1960s, stack architectures became popular. They were viewed as being a good match for high-level languages—and they probably were, given the compiler tech- nology of the day. In the 1970s, the main concern of architects was how to reduce software costs. This concern was met primarily by replacing software with hard- ware, or by providing high-level architectures that could simplify the task of soft- ware designers. The result was both the high-level language computer architecture movement and powerful architectures like the VAX, which has a large number of addressing modes, multiple data types, and a highly orthogonal architecture. In the 1980s, more sophisticated compiler technology and a renewed emphasis on pro- cessor performance saw a return to simpler architectures, based mainly on the load-store style of computer.

> 最早的体系结构在当时的硬件技术的指导集中受到限制。一旦允许硬件技术，计算机架构师就开始寻找支持高级语言的方法。这次搜索导致有关如何有效支持计划的三个不同的思考。在 1960 年代，Stack Architectures 变得流行。他们被认为是高级语言的很好匹配，鉴于当天的编译器技术，它们可能是如此。在 1970 年代，工程师的主要关注点是如何降低软件成本。这一问题主要是通过用硬件替换软件，或提供可以简化软件设计师任务的高级体系结构来替换软件。结果既是高级语言计算机体系结构运动，也是 VAX 等强大的体系结构，该体系结构具有大量的寻址模式，多种数据类型和高度正交架构。在 1980 年代，更复杂的编译器技术和对专业绩效的重新强调，主要基于计算机的负载店风格，回到了更简单的体系结构。

The following instruction set architecture changes occurred in the 1990s:

> 以下指令集架构变化发生在 1990 年代：

- _Address size doubles_—The 32-bit address instruction sets for most desktop and server processors were extended to 64-bit addresses, expanding the width of the registers (among other things) to 64 bits. Appendix K gives three examples of architectures that have gone from 32 bits to 64 bits.

> - _address 大小双打 - 大多数台式机和服务器处理器的 32 位地址指令集将其扩展到 64 位地址，将寄存器的宽度(除其他事项)扩展到 64 位。附录 K 给出了三个从 32 位到 64 位的体系结构示例。

- _Optimization of conditional branches via conditional execution_—In [Chapter 3](#_bookmark93), we see that conditional branches can limit the performance of aggressive com- puter designs. Hence, there was interest in replacing conditional branches with conditional completion of operations, such as conditional move (see Appendix H), which was added to most instruction sets.

> - _通过有条件执行的条件分支对条件分支_-在[第 3 章](#_ bookmark93)中，我们看到条件分支可以限制激进的分配器设计的性能。因此，有兴趣通过有条件完成操作(例如有条件移动)替换有条件的分支机构(请参阅附录 H)，并将其添加到大多数指令集中。

- _Optimization of cache performance via prefetch_—[Chapter 2](#_bookmark46) explains the increasing role of memory hierarchy in the performance of computers, with a cache miss on some computers taking as many instruction times as page faults took on earlier computers. Hence, prefetch instructions were added to try to hide the cost of cache misses by prefetching (see [Chapter 2](#_bookmark46)).

> - _通过预摘要对缓存性能进行访问_- [第 2 章](#_ bookmark46)解释了内存层次结构在计算机性能中的越来越多的作用，而在某些计算机上的缓存失误则在某些计算机上遇到了随着页面故障为较早的计算机上的许多指令时间。因此，添加了预取指令，以尝试通过预摘要来隐藏高速缓存的成本(请参阅[第 2 章](#_ bookmark46))。

- _Support for multimedia_—Most desktop and embedded instruction sets were extended with support for multimedia applications.

> - _多媒体_support-扩展了大多数桌面和嵌入式指令集，并支持多媒体应用程序。

- _Faster floating-point operations_—Appendix J describes operations added to enhance floating-point performance, such as operations that perform a multiply and an add and paired single execution, which are part of RISC-V. Between 1970 and 1985 many thought the primary job of the computer architect was the design of instruction sets. As a result, textbooks of that era emphasize instruction set design, much as computer architecture textbooks of the 1950s and 1960s empha- sized computer arithmetic. The educated architect was expected to have strong opin- ions about the strengths and especially the weaknesses of the popular computers. The importance of binary compatibility in quashing innovations in instruction set design was unappreciated by many researchers and textbook writers, giving the impression that many architects would get a chance to design an instruction set.

> - _faster 浮点操作_-附录 J 描述了添加的操作以增强浮点功能，例如执行乘以乘和添加和配对的单执行的操作，这些执行是 RISC-V 的一部分。在 1970 年至 1985 年之间，许多人认为计算机架构师的主要工作是教学集的设计。结果，那个时代的教科书强调了指导集设计，就像 1950 年代和 1960 年代的计算机架构教科书一样，强大的计算机算术。受过教育的工程师预计将对优势，尤其是流行计算机的劣势具有强烈的意见。许多研究人员和教科书作家对二进制兼容性在指导集设计中的创新的重要性没有欣赏，这给人的印象是，许多工程师将有机会设计指导集。

The definition of computer architecture today has been expanded to include design and evaluation of the full computer system—not just the definition of the instruction set and not just the processor—and hence there are plenty of topics for the architect to study. In fact, the material in this appendix was a central point of the book in its first edition in 1990, but now is included in an appendix primarily as reference material!

> 当今的计算机架构的定义已扩展到包括完整计算机系统的设计和评估，不仅仅是指令集的定义，而不仅仅是处理器的定义，因此，工程师有很多主题可以研究。实际上，本附录中的材料是 1990 年第一版中书籍的核心点，但现在已包含在附录中，主要是作为参考材料！

Appendix K may satisfy readers interested in instruction set architecture; it describes a variety of instruction sets, which are either important in the marketplace today or historically important, and it compares nine popular load-store computers with RISC-V.

> 附录 K 可能会满足对教学集架构感兴趣的读者；它描述了各种说明集，这些指令集在当今的市场中很重要，或者历史上很重要，并且将九台流行的负载商店计算机与 RISC-V 进行了比较。
