## Introduction

Embedded computer systems—computers lodged in other devices where the presence of the computers is not immediately obvious—are the fastest-growing portion of the computer market. These devices range from everyday machines (most microwaves, most washing machines, printers, network switches, and automobiles contain simple to very advanced embedded microprocessors) to handheld digital devices (such as PDAs, cell phones, and music players) to video game consoles and digital set-top boxes. Although in some applications (such as PDAs) the computers are programmable, in many embedded applications the only programming occurs in connection with the initial loading of the application code or a later software upgrade of that application. Thus, the application is carefully tuned for the processor and system. This process sometimes includes limited use of assembly language in key loops, although time-to-market pressures and good software engineering practice restrict such assembly language coding to a fraction of the application.

> 嵌入式计算机系统——安装在其他设备中的计算机，这些设备的存在不是很明显——是计算机市场增长最快的部分。这些设备的范围从日常机器(大多数微波炉、大多数洗衣机、打印机、网络交换机和汽车都包含简单到非常先进的嵌入式微处理器)到手持数字设备(例如 PDA、手机和音乐播放器)到视频游戏机和 数字机顶盒。尽管在某些应用程序(例如 PDA)中，计算机是可编程的，但在许多嵌入式应用程序中，唯一的编程发生在应用程序代码的初始加载或该应用程序的以后软件升级方面。因此，应用程序针对处理器和系统进行了仔细调整。这个过程有时包括在关键循环中有限地使用汇编语言，尽管上市时间压力和良好的软件工程实践将这种汇编语言编码限制在应用程序的一小部分。

Compared to desktop and server systems, embedded systems have a much wider range of processing power and cost—from systems containing low-end 8bit and 16-bit processors that may cost less than a dollar, to those containing full 32-bit microprocessors capable of operating in the 500 MIPS range that cost approximately 10 dollars, to those containing high-end embedded processors that cost hundreds of dollars and can execute several billions of instructions per second. Although the range of computing power in the embedded systems market is very large, price is a key factor in the design of computers for this space. Performance requirements do exist, of course, but the primary goal is often meeting the performance need at a minimum price, rather than achieving higher performance at a higher price.

> 与台式机和服务器系统相比，嵌入式系统具有更广泛的处理能力和成本——从包含成本可能低于一美元的低端 8 位和 16 位处理器的系统到包含功能强大的全 32 位微处理器的系统 从成本大约为 10 美元的 500 MIPS 范围内运行的处理器到成本为数百美元且每秒可执行数十亿条指令的包含高端嵌入式处理器的处理器。尽管嵌入式系统市场的计算能力范围非常大，但价格是为该领域设计计算机的关键因素。当然，性能需求确实存在，但首要目标往往是以最低的价格满足性能需求，而不是以更高的价格获得更高的性能。

Embedded systems often process information in very different ways from general-purpose processors. Typically these applications include deadline-driven constraints—so-called `real-time constraints.` In these applications, a particular computation must be completed by a certain time or the system fails (there are other constraints considered real time, discussed in the next subsection).

> 嵌入式系统通常以与通用处理器非常不同的方式处理信息。通常，这些应用程序包括截止日期驱动的约束 如此称为\_real-time 约束。)。

Embedded systems applications typically involve processing information as `signals.` The lay term `signal` often connotes radio transmission, and that is true for some embedded systems (e.g., cell phones). But a signal may be an image, a motion picture composed of a series of images, a control sensor measurement, and so on. Signal processing requires specific computation that many embedded processors are optimized for. We discuss this in depth below. A wide range of benchmark requirements exist, from the ability to run small, limited code segments to the ability to perform well on applications involving tens to hundreds of thousands of lines of code.

> 嵌入式系统应用程序通常涉及处理信息为\_signals。但是信号可以是图像，是由一系列图像组成的电影，控制传感器测量等等。信号处理需要对许多嵌入式监管者进行优化的特定计算。我们在下面深入讨论这一点。从运行小的，有限的代码段的能力到在涉及数十万行的应用程序到成千上万行代码的应用程序中，都有广泛的基准要求。

Two other key characteristics exist in many embedded applications: the need to minimize memory and the need to minimize power. In many embedded applications, the memory can be a substantial portion of the system cost, and it is important to optimize memory size in such cases. Sometimes the application is expected to fit entirely in the memory on the processor chip; other times the application needs to fit in its entirety in a small, off-chip memory. In either case, the importance of memory size translates to an emphasis on code size, since data size is dictated by the application. Some architectures have special instruction set capabilities to reduce code size. Larger memories also mean more power, and optimizing power is often critical in embedded applications. Although the emphasis on low power is frequently driven by the use of batteries, the need to use less expensive packaging (plastic versus ceramic) and the absence of a fan for cooling also limit total power consumption. We examine the issue of power in more detail later in this appendix.

> 在许多嵌入式应用程序中，还有其他两个关键特征：需要最大程度地减少内存和最小化功率的需求。在许多嵌入式应用中，内存可能是系统成本的很大一部分，在这种情况下，优化内存大小很重要。有时，该应用程序有望完全适合处理器芯片上的内存；其他时候，该应用程序需要完整地适合片的小芯片内存。无论哪种情况，内存尺寸的重要性都可以重点放在代码大小上，因为数据大小是由应用程序决定的。一些体系结构具有特殊的指令集功能以减少代码尺寸。较大的记忆也意味着更多的功率，而优化功率通常在嵌入式应用中至关重要。尽管对低功率的强调通常是由使用电池的使用驱动的，但使用较便宜的包装(塑料与陶瓷)的需求以及没有风扇进行冷却也限制了总功耗。我们在本附录后面更详细地研究了权力问题。

Another important trend in embedded systems is the use of processor cores together with application-specific circuitry—so-called `core plus ASIC` or `system on a chip` (SOC), which may also be viewed as special-purpose multiprocessors (see Section E.4). Often an application’s functional and performance requirements are met by combining a custom hardware solution together with software running on a standardized embedded processor core, which is designed to interface to such special-purpose hardware. In practice, embedded problems are usually solved by one of three approaches:

> 嵌入式系统的另一个重要趋势是将处理器芯与应用特定的电路一起使用 如此被称为 `核心加上 ASIC` 或 `芯片上的系统`(SOC)，也可以将其视为特殊用途的多种多样。-SOR(请参阅 E.4 节)。通常，通过将自定义硬件解决方案与在标准化的嵌入式处理器核心上运行的软件结合在一起，可以满足应用程序的功能和性能要求，该解决方案旨在与此类特殊用途的硬件接口。实际上，嵌入式问题通常通过三种方法之一解决：

1. The designer uses a combined hardware/software solution that includes some custom hardware and an embedded processor core that is integrated with the custom hardware, often on the same chip.
2. The designer uses custom software running on an off-the-shelf embedded processor.
3. The designer uses a digital signal processor and custom software for the processor. `Digital signal processors` are processors specially tailored for signalprocessing applications. We discuss some of the important differences between digital signal processors and general-purpose embedded processors below.

Figure E.1 summarizes these three classes of computing environments and their important characteristics.

### Real-Time Processing

> 看标题这里给出了关于嵌入式系统上常常提到的实时的概念

Often, the performance requirement in an embedded application is a real-time requirement. A `real-time performance requirement` is one where a segment of the application has an absolute maximum execution time that is allowed. For example, in a digital set-top box the time to process each video frame is limited, since the processor must accept and process the frame before the next frame arrives (typically called _hard real-time systems_). In some applications, a more sophisticated requirement exists: The average time for a particular task is constrained as well as is the number of instances when some maximum time is exceeded. Such approaches (typically called _soft real-time_) arise when it is possible to occasionally miss the time constraint on an event, as long as not too many are missed. Real-time performance tends to be highly application dependent. It is usually measured using kernels either from the application or from a standardized benchmark (see Section E.3).

> 通常，嵌入式应用程序中的性能要求是实时要求。`实时性能要求` 是应用程序的一部分具有允许的绝对最大执行时间的要求。例如，在数字机顶盒中，处理每个视频帧的时间是有限的，因为处理器必须在下一帧到达之前接受并处理该帧(通常称为*硬实时系统*)。在某些应用程序中，存在更复杂的要求：限制特定任务的平均时间以及超过某个最大时间的实例数。这种方法(通常称为 *soft real-time*)出现在有可能偶尔错过事件的时间限制时，只要没有错过太多。实时性能往往高度依赖于应用程序。它通常使用来自应用程序或标准化基准测试的内核进行测量(请参阅第 E.3 节)。

Figure E.1 A summary of the three computing classes and their system characteristics. Note the wide range in system price for servers and embedded systems. For servers, this range arises from the need for very large-scale multiprocessor systems for high-end transaction processing and Web server applications. For embedded systems, one significant high-end application is a network router, which could include multiple processors as well as lots of memory and other electronics. The total number of embedded processors sold in 2000 is estimated to exceed 1 billion, if you include 8-bit and 16-bit microprocessors. In fact, the largest-selling microprocessor of all time is an 8-bit microcontroller sold by Intel! It is difficult to separate the low end of the server market from the desktop market, since lowend servers—especially those costing less than $5000—are essentially no different from desktop PCs. Hence, up to a few million of the PC units may be effectively servers.

> 图 E.1 三种计算类别及其系统特征的总结。请注意服务器和嵌入式系统的系统价格差异很大。对于服务器，这个范围源于对用于高端事务处理和 Web 服务器应用程序的超大规模多处理器系统的需求。对于嵌入式系统，一个重要的高端应用是网络路由器，它可能包括多个处理器以及大量内存和其他电子设备。如果算上 8 位和 16 位微处理器，2000 年嵌入式处理器的总销量估计超过 10 亿颗。事实上，有史以来销量最大的微处理器是英特尔销售的 8 位微控制器！ 很难将低端服务器市场与台式机市场区分开来，因为低端服务器——尤其是那些成本低于 5000 美元的服务器——在本质上与台式机没有区别。因此，多达几百万台 PC 单元可能实际上是服务器。

The construction of a hard real-time system involves three key variables. The first is the rate at which a particular task must occur. Coupled to this are the hardware and software required to achieve that real-time rate. Often, structures that are very advantageous on the desktop are the enemy of hard real-time analysis. For example, branch speculation, cache memories, and so on introduce `uncertainty` into code. A particular sequence of code may execute either very efficiently or very inefficiently, depending on whether the hardware branch predictors and caches `do their jobs.` Engineers must analyze code assuming the `worst-case execution time` (WCET). In the case of traditional microprocessor hardware, if one assumes that `all branches are mispredicted` and `all caches miss,` the WCET is overly pessimistic. Thus, the system designer may end up overdesigning a system to achieve a given WCET, when a much less expensive system would have sufficed.

> 硬实时系统的构建涉及三个关键变量。
> 第一个是特定任务必须发生的速率。与此相结合的是实现该实时速率所需的硬件和软件。通常，在桌面上非常有利的结构是硬实时分析的敌人。例如，分支推测、缓存存储器等将 `不确定性` 引入代码。特定代码序列的执行效率可能非常高，也可能非常低，这取决于硬件分支预测器和缓存是否 `完成它们的工作`。工程师必须假设 `最坏情况执行时间`(WCET) 来分析代码。在传统微处理器硬件的情况下，如果假设 `所有分支都被错误预测` 和 `所有缓存都未命中`，那么 WCET 就过于悲观了。因此，当一个便宜得多的系统就足够了时，系统设计者可能最终会过度设计系统以实现给定的 WCET。

In order to address the challenges of hard real-time systems, and yet still exploit such well-known architectural properties as branch behavior and access locality, it is possible to change how a processor is designed. Consider branch prediction: Although dynamic branch prediction is known to perform far more accurately than static `hint bits` added to branch instructions, the behavior of static hints is much more predictable. Furthermore, although caches perform better than softwaremanaged on-chip memories, the latter produces predictable memory latencies. In some embedded processors, caches can be converted into software-managed on-chip memories via `line locking.` In this approach, a cache line can be locked in the cache so that it cannot be replaced until the line is unlocked

> 为了应对硬实时系统的挑战，同时仍然利用分支行为和访问局部性等众所周知的架构属性，可以改变处理器的设计方式。考虑分支预测：虽然动态分支预测比添加到分支指令的静态 `提示位` 准确得多，但静态提示的行为更可预测。此外，尽管缓存的性能优于软件管理的片上存储器，但后者会产生可预测的内存延迟。在某些嵌入式处理器中，可以通过 `行锁定` 将缓存转换为软件管理的片上存储器。在这种方法中，可以将缓存行锁定在缓存中，以便在行解锁之前无法替换它
