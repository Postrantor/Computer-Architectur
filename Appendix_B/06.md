## Concluding Remarks

The difficulty of building a memory system to keep pace with faster processors is underscored by the fact that the raw material for main memory is the same as that found in the cheapest computer. It is the principle of locality that helps us here—its soundness is demonstrated at all levels of the memory hierarchy in current computers, from disks to TLBs.

> 由于主存的原材料与最便宜的计算机中的原材料相同，这一事实凸显了构建内存系统以跟上更快的处理器步伐的难度。局部性原理在这里对我们有帮助——它的稳健性在当前计算机的内存层次结构的所有级别上得到证明，从磁盘到 TLB。

However, the increasing relative latency to memory, taking hundreds of clock cycles in 2016, means that programmers and compiler writers must be aware of the parameters of the caches and TLBs if they want their programs to perform well.

> 然而，内存的相对延迟增加，在 2016 年需要数百个时钟周期，这意味着程序员和编译器编写者如果希望他们的程序运行良好，就必须了解缓存和 TLB 的参数。
