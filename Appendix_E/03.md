## Embedded Benchmarks

It used to be the case just a couple of years ago that in the embedded market, many manufacturers quoted Dhrystone performance, a benchmark that was criticized and given up by desktop systems more than 20 years ago! As mentioned earlier, the enormous variety in embedded applications, as well as differences in performance requirements (hard real time, soft real time, and overall cost-performance), make the use of a single set of benchmarks unrealistic. In practice, many designers of embedded systems devise benchmarks that reflect their application, either as ker- nels or as stand-alone versions of the entire application.

> 几年前，过去几年中，许多制造商引用了 Dhrystone Performance，这是 20 年前桌面系统批评和放弃的基准！如前所述，嵌入式应用程序中的巨大种类以及性能需求的差异(硬实时，软实时和整体成本绩效)，使使用一组基准不现实。实际上，许多嵌入式系统的设计师设计了反映其应用的基准，无论是 Kernels 还是作为整个应用程序的独立版本。

For those embedded applications that can be characterized well by kernel per- formance, the best standardized set of benchmarks appears to be a new benchmark set: the EDN Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium (or EEMBC, pronounced  "embassy" ). The EEMBC benchmarks fall into six classes (called  "subcommittees"  in the parlance of EEMBC): automotive/industrial, consumer, telecommunications, digital entertainment, networking (currently in its second ver- sion), and office automation (also the second version of this subcommittee). Figure E.8 shows the six different application classes, which include 50 benchmarks.

> 对于那些可以通过内核性能很好地表征的嵌入式应用程序，最好的标准化基准测试集似乎是一个新的基准测试集：EDN 嵌入式微处理器基准测试联盟(或 EEMBC，发音为 "大使馆" )。EEMBC 基准分为六类(用 EEMBC 的说法称为 "小组委员会" )：汽车/工业、消费品、电信、数字娱乐、网络(目前是第二版)和办公自动化(也是 EEMBC 的第二版) 这个小组委员会)。图 E.8 显示了六个不同的应用程序类别，其中包括 50 个基准。

Although many embedded applications are sensitive to the performance of small kernels, remember that often the overall performance of the entire application (which may be thousands of lines) is also critical. Thus, for many embedded sys- tems, the EMBCC benchmarks can only be used to partially assess performance.

> 尽管许多嵌入式应用程序对小内核的性能很敏感，但请记住，通常整个应用程序(可能有数千行)的整体性能也很关键。因此，对于许多嵌入式系统，EMBCC 基准测试只能用于部分评估性能。

### Power Consumption and Efficiency as the Metric

Cost and power are often at least as important as performance in the embedded market. In addition to the cost of the processor module (which includes any required interface chips), memory is often the next most costly part of an embedded system. Unlike a desktop or server system, most embedded systems do not have secondary storage; instead, the entire application must reside in either FLASH or DRAM. Because many embedded systems, such as PDAs and cell phones, are con- strained by both cost and physical size, the amount of memory needed for the appli- cation is critical. Likewise, power is often a determining factor in choosing a processor, especially for battery-powered systems.

> 成本和功率通常至少与嵌入式市场的性能一样重要。除了处理器模块的成本(包括任何必需的接口芯片)外，内存通常是嵌入式系统的下一个最昂贵的一部分。与台式机或服务器系统不同，大多数嵌入式系统都没有辅助存储。相反，整个应用程序必须驻留在闪存或 DRAM 中。由于许多嵌入式系统(例如 PDA 和手机)都受到成本和物理大小的影响，因此应用所需的记忆量至关重要。同样，功率通常是选择处理器的决定因素，尤其是对于电池动力系统。

EEMBC EnergyBench provides data on the amount of energy a processor con- sumes while running EEMBC’s performance benchmarks. An EEMBC-certified Energymark score is an optional metric that a device manufacturer may choose to supply in conjunction with certified scores for device performance as a way of indicating a processor’s efficient use of power and energy. EEMBC has stan- dardized on the use of National Instruments’ LabVIEW graphical development environment and data acquisition hardware to implement EnergyBench.

[Figure E.9](#_bookmark581) shows the relative performance per watt of typical operating power. Compare this figure to [Figure E.10](#_bookmark582), which plots raw performance, and notice how different the results are. The NEC VR 4122 has a clear advantage in performance per watt, but is the second-lowest performing processor! From the viewpoint of power consumption, the NEC VR 4122, which was designed for battery-based sys- tems, is the big winner. The IBM PowerPC displays efficient use of power to achieve its high performance, although at 6 W typical, it is probably not suitable for most battery-based devices.

> [图 E.9](#_Bookmark581) 显示了典型操作功率每瓦的相对性能。将该图与[图 E.10](#_Bookmark582) 进行比较，该图绘制了原始性能，并注意结果有多不同。NEC VR 4122 在每瓦的性能方面具有明显的优势，但性能是第二高的处理器！从功耗的角度来看，为基于电池的系统设计的 NEC VR 4122 是最大的赢家。IBM PowerPC 显示有效利用功率来实现其高性能，尽管在典型的 6 W 时，它可能不适用于大多数基于电池的设备。
