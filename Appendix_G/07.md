## Concluding Remarks

> ##总结

During the 1980s and 1990s, rapid performance increases in pipelined scalar pro- cessors led to a dramatic closing of the gap between traditional vector supercom- puters and fast, pipelined, superscalar VLSI microprocessors. In 2011, it is possible to buy a laptop computer for under $1000 that has a higher CPU clock rate than any available vector supercomputer, even those costing tens of millions of dollars. Although the vector supercomputers have lower clock rates, they support greater parallelism using multiple lanes (up to 16 in the Japanese designs) versus the lim- ited multiple issue of the superscalar microprocessors. Nevertheless, the peak floating-point performance of the low-cost microprocessors is within a factor of two of the leading vector supercomputer CPUs. Of course, high clock rates and high peak performance do not necessarily translate into sustained application performance. Main memory bandwidth is the key distinguishing feature between vector supercomputers and superscalar microprocessor systems.

> 在 1980 年代和 1990 年代，管道标量专业人员的快速性能提高导致传统矢量超级计算机与快速，管道上的超大型 VLSI 微处理器之间的差距发生了巨大缩小。在 2011 年，可以以低于 1000 美元的价格购买一台笔记本电脑，其 CPU 时钟速率高于任何可用的矢量超级计算机，即使是那些耗资数千万美元的矢量超级计算机。尽管矢量超级计算机的时钟速率较低，但它们使用多个车道(日本设计中最多 16 个)支持更大的并行性，而不是超级级别微处理器的多个问题。然而，低成本微处理器的峰值浮点性能在两个领先的矢量超级计算机 CPU 的倍数之内。当然，高时钟速率和高峰值性能不一定会转化为持续的应用程序性能。主要存储器带宽是向量超级计算机和超量表微处理器系统之间的关键区分功能。

Providing this large non-unit stride memory bandwidth is one of the major expenses in a vector supercomputer, and traditionally SRAM was used as main memory to reduce the number of memory banks needed and to reduce vector start-up penalties. While SRAM has an access time several times lower than that of DRAM, it costs roughly 10 times as much per bit! To reduce main memory costs and to allow larger capacities, all modern vector supercomputers now use DRAM for main memory, taking advantage of new higher-bandwidth DRAM interfaces such as synchronous DRAM.

> 规定这一大型非单位步步记忆带宽是向量超级计算机的主要费用之一，传统上，SRAM 被用作主要内存，以减少所需的内存库数量并减少矢量启动罚款。虽然 SRAM 的访问时间比 DRAM 低几倍，但每位的费用约为每位的 10 倍！为了降低主要记忆成本并允许更大的能力，所有现代矢量超级计算机现在都将 DRAM 用于主内存，利用了新的高带宽 DRAM 接口(例如同步 DRAM)。

This adoption of DRAM for main memory (pioneered by Seymour Cray in the Cray-2) is one example of how vector supercomputers have adapted commodity technology to improve their price-performance. Another example is that vector supercomputers are now including vector data caches. Caches are not effective for all vector codes, however, so these vector caches are designed to allow high main memory bandwidth even in the presence of many cache misses. For example, the Cray X1 MSP can have 2048 outstanding memory loads; for microprocessors, 8 to 16 outstanding cache misses per CPU are more typical maximum numbers. Another example is the demise of bipolar ECL or gallium arsenide as technol- ogies of choice for supercomputer CPU logic. Because of the huge investment in CMOS technology made possible by the success of the desktop computer, CMOS now offers competitive transistor performance with much greater transistor density and much reduced power dissipation compared with these more exotic technolo- gies. As a result, all leading vector supercomputers are now built with the same CMOS technology as superscalar microprocessors. The primary reason why vector supercomputers have lower clock rates than commodity microprocessors is that they are developed using standard cell ASIC techniques rather than full custom circuit design to reduce the engineering design cost. While a microprocessor design may sell tens of millions of copies and can amortize the design cost over this large number of units, a vector supercomputer is considered a success if over a hundred units are sold!

> 这种 DRAM 用于主要记忆(由 Cray-2 中的 Seymour Cray 开创)是矢量超级计算机如何改编商品技术以提高其价格绩效的一个例子。另一个示例是，矢量超级计算机现在包括向量数据缓存。缓存对于所有矢量代码都不有效，因此，即使在存在许多缓存误差的情况下，这些矢量缓存也允许高主内存带宽。例如，Cray X1 MSP 可以具有 2048 个出色的内存负载；对于微处理器而言，每次 CPU 的 8 至 16 个出色的高速缓存失误是更典型的最大数字。另一个例子是将双极 ECL 或砷化甘氨酸作为超级计算机 CPU 逻辑的首选技术。由于台式计算机的成功使 CMOS 技术的大量投资成为可能，因此 CMO 现在提供竞争性的晶体管性能，其晶体管密度更高，并且与这些更奇特的技术相比，晶体管密度更高，功率耗散大大减少。结果，现在所有领先的向量超级计算机都使用与超级量表微处理器相同的 CMOS 技术构建。矢量超级计算机的时钟速率低于商品微处理器的主要原因是，它们是使用标准单元格技术而不是完整的自定义电路设计开发的，以降低工程设计成本。虽然微处理器设计可能会出售数千万册，并且可以在这大量单元上摊销设计成本，但如果出售了一百多个单位，则将矢量超级计算机视为成功！

Conversely, via superscalar microprocessor designs have begun to absorb some of the techniques made popular in earlier vector computer systems, such as with the Multimedia SIMD extensions. As we showed in [Chapter 4](#_bookmark165), the invest- ment in hardware for SIMD performance is increasing rapidly, perhaps even more than for multiprocessors. If the even wider SIMD units of GPUs become well inte- grated with the scalar cores, including scatter-gather support, we may well con- clude that vector architectures have won the architecture wars!

> 相反，通过超量表微处理器设计已经开始吸收一些在早期的矢量计算机系统中流行的技术，例如使用 Multimedia Simd 扩展。正如我们在[第 4 章](#_bookmark165)中所显示的那样，硬件的 SIMD 性能投资正在迅速增加，甚至比多处理器更重要。如果 GPU 的更广泛的 SIMD 单位与标量核心(包括散落的聚集支持)相处得很好，那么我们很可能会确定矢量体系结构赢得了建筑战争！
