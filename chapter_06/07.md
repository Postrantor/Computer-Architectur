Inheriting the title of building the world’s biggest computers, computer architects of WSCs are designing the large part of the future IT that supports the mobile client and IoT devices. Many of us use WSCs many times a day, and the number of times per day and the number of people using WSCs will surely increase in the next decade. Already more than six billion of the seven billion people on the planet have cell phone subscriptions. As these devices become Internet-ready, many more people from around the world will be able to benefit from WSCs.

> WSC 的计算机架构师继承了构建世界上最大的计算机的标题，正在设计支持移动客户端和物联网设备的未来大部分 IT。我们中的许多人每天使用多次 WSC，每天的次数和使用 WSC 的人数肯定会在未来十年内增加。在地球上有 70 亿人中，已经有超过 60 亿人有手机订阅。随着这些设备准备就绪，世界各地的更多人将能够从 WSC 中受益。

Moreover, the economies of scale uncovered by WSC have realized the longdreamed-of goal of computing as a utility. Cloud computing means anyone anywhere with good ideas and business models can tap thousands of servers to deliver their vision almost instantly. Of course, there are important obstacles that could limit the growth of cloud computing around standards, privacy, the rate of growth of Internet bandwidth, and the pitfalls we mention in [Section 6.8](#_bookmark312), but we foresee them being addressed so that cloud computing can continue to flourish.

> 此外，WSC 发现的规模经济已经意识到了计算作为实用程序的长期以来的目标。云计算意味着任何拥有好的想法和商业模型的任何人都可以利用数千台服务器几乎立即实现其愿景。当然，存在一些重要的障碍，可能会限制围绕标准，隐私，互联网带宽增长率以及我们在[6.8]第 6.8](#\_ bookmark312)中提到的陷阱的云计算的增长，但是我们预计它们被解决了云计算可以继续蓬勃发展。

Among the many attractive features of cloud computing is that it offers economic incentives for conservation. Whereas it is hard to convince cloud computing _providers_ to turn off unused equipment to save energy given the cost of the infrastructure investment, it is easy to convince cloud computing _users_ to give up idle instances since they are paying for them, whether or not they are doing anything useful. Similarly, charging by use encourages programmers to use computation, communication, and storage efficiently, which can be difficult to encourage without an understandable pricing scheme. The explicit pricing also makes it possible for researchers to evaluate innovations in cost-performance instead of just performance, because costs are now easily measured and believable. Finally, cloud computing means that researchers can evaluate their ideas at the scale of thousands of computers, which in the past only large companies could afford.

> 云计算的许多吸引人的特征是，它提供了保护的经济激励措施。尽管很难说服云计算 *providers *在基础设施投资的成本下关闭未使用的设备以节省能源，但很容易说服云计算* users*放弃空闲实例，因为它们是否为它们付费，做任何有用的事情。同样，通过使用充电会鼓励程序员有效地使用计算，通信和存储，这在没有可以理解的定价方案的情况下很难鼓励。明确的定价还使研究人员可以评估成本绩效的创新，而不是仅仅是绩效，因为现在很容易衡量和可信成本。最后，云计算意味着研究人员可以按数千台计算机的规模评估他们的想法，而过去只有大公司能够负担得起。

We believe that WSCs are changing the goals and principles of server design, just as the needs of mobile clients and IoT are changing the goals and principles of microprocessor design. Both are revolutionizing the software industry, as well. Performance per dollar and performance per joule drive both mobile client hardware and the WSC hardware, and parallelism and domain-specific accelerators are key to delivering on those sets of goals. Architects will play a vital role in both halves of this exciting future world.

> 我们认为，WSC 正在改变服务器设计的目标和原理，就像移动客户和物联网的需求正在改变微处理器设计的目标和原理一样。两者也都在彻底改变软件行业。每美元的性能和每次焦点驱动器的性能既可以移动客户端硬件和 WSC 硬件，又是并行性和特定于域的加速器是实现这些目标集的关键。工程师将在这个令人兴奋的未来世界的两半中发挥至关重要的作用。

Looking forward, the end of Moore’s Law and Dennard scaling ([Chapter 1](#_bookmark2)) means that the single-thread performance of the newest processors is not that much faster than their predecessors, which will likely stretch the lifetimes of the servers in the WSCs. Thus, the money formerly spent replacing older servers will instead be used to expand to the cloud, which could mean that the cloud will be even more economically attractive in the next decade than it is today. The Moore’s Law era combined with innovations in the design and operation of WSCs caused the performance-cost-energy curve of WSCs to improve continuously. With the end of that glorious era, plus the removal of the largest causes of inefficiency in WSCs, the field will likely need to look to for innovations in computer architecture of the chips that populate the WSC for sustained improvement, which is the topic of the next chapter.

> 展望未来，摩尔定律和丹纳德缩放的结束([[第 1 章](#\_ bookmark2))意味着，最新处理器的单线程性能并不比其前任更快，这可能会延长服务器的寿命在 WSC 中。因此，以前花费的替换旧服务器的钱将被用来扩展到云中，这可能意味着在未来十年中，云在经济上将比今天更具吸引力。摩尔的法律时代与 WSC 的设计和操作中的创新相结合，导致 WSC 的性能成本能量曲线不断改进。随着那个光荣的时代的结束，加上 WSC 效率低下的最大原因，该领域很可能需要寻找筹码的计算机架构创新，这些芯片构建了筹集 WSC 以持续改进的芯片，这是一个主题下一章。
