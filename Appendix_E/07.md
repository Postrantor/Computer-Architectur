## Case Study: Inside a Cell Phone

> ##案例研究：在手机中

Although gaming consoles and digital cameras are familiar embedded systems, today the most familiar embedded system is the cell phone. In 1999, there were 76 million cellular subscribers in the United States, a 25% growth rate from the year before. That growth rate is almost 35% per year worldwide, as developing countries find it much cheaper to install cellular towers than copper-wire-based infrastructure. Thus, in many countries, the number of cell phones in use exceeds the number of wired phones in use.

> 尽管游戏机和数码相机是熟悉的嵌入式系统，但如今，最熟悉的嵌入式系统是手机。1999 年，美国有 7600 万个蜂窝用户，与前一年相比增长了 25％。由于发展中国家发现，安装蜂窝塔比基于铜线的基础设施便宜得多，因此该增长率每年几乎为 35％。因此，在许多国家 /地区，使用的手机数量超过了使用的有线电话的数量。

Not surprisingly, the cellular handset market is growing at 35% per year, with about 280 million cellular phone handsets sold worldwide in 1999. To put that in perspective, in the same year sales of personal computers were 120 million. These numbers mean that tremendous engineering resources are available to improve cell phones, and cell phones are probably leaders in engineering innovation per cubic inch \[Grice and Kanellos 2000\].

> 毫不奇怪，蜂窝手机市场每年增长 35％，1999 年在全球范围内销售约 2.8 亿个手机手机。从角度看，在同一年，个人计算机的销售额为 1.2 亿。这些数字意味着可以使用巨大的工程资源来改善手机，手机可能是每立方英寸工程创新的领导者[Grice and Kanellos 2000 \]。

Before unveiling the anatomy of a cell phone, let’s try a short introduction to wireless technology.

### Background on Wireless Networks

> ###无线网络背景

Networks can be created out of thin air as well as out of copper and glass, creating _wireless networks._ Much of this section is based on a report from the National Research Council \[1997\].

A radio wave is an electromagnetic wave propagated by an antenna. Radio waves are modulated, which means that the sound signal is superimposed on the stronger radio wave that carries the sound signal, and hence is called the _carrier signal._ Radio waves have a particular wavelength or frequency: They are measured either as the length of the complete wave or as the number of waves per second. Long waves have low frequencies, and short waves have high frequencies. FM radio stations transmit on the band of 88 MHz to 108 MHz using frequency mod- ulations (FM) to record the sound signal.

> 无线电波是由天线传播的电磁波。无线电波是调制的，这意味着声音信号叠加在带有声音信号的更强的无线电波上，因此称为_ carrier 信号。完整的波浪或每秒波数。长波具有低频，而短波具有高频。FM 广播电台使用频率模拟（FM）在 88 MHz 的频带上传输到 108 MHz，以记录声音信号。

By tuning in to different frequencies, a radio receiver can pick up a specific signal. In addition to AM and FM radio, other frequencies are reserved for citizens band radio, television, pagers, air traffic control radar, Global Positioning System, and so on. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission decides who gets to use which frequencies and for what purpose.

> 通过调谐到不同的频率，无线电接收器可以拾取特定的信号。除了 AM 和 FM 广播外，其他频率还为公民乐队广播，电视，寻呼机，空中交通管制雷达，全球定位系统等保留。在美国，联邦通信委员会决定谁可以使用哪些频率以及出于什么目的。

The _bit error rate_ (BER) of a wireless link is determined by the received signal power, noise due to interference caused by the receiver hardware, interference from other sources, and characteristics of the channel. Noise is typically proportional to the radio frequency bandwidth, and a key measure is the _signal-to-noise ratio_ (SNR) required to achieve a given BER. Figure E.14 lists more challenges for wire- less communication.

> 无线链接的_bit 错误率_（BER）取决于接收的信号功率，由于接收器硬件引起的干扰，其他来源的干扰以及通道的特征。噪声通常与射频带宽成正比，关键的度量是实现给定的 BER 所需的_信号与噪声比率_（SNR）。图 E.14 列出了更多无线通信的挑战。

Typically, wireless communication is selected because the communicating devices are mobile or because wiring is inconvenient, which means the wireless network must rearrange itself dynamically. Such rearrangement makes routing

> 通常，选择无线通信是因为通信设备是移动设备或接线是不便的，这意味着无线网络必须动态重新排列。这样的重排使路由

more challenging. A second challenge is that wireless signals are not protected and hence are subject to mutual interference, especially as devices move. Power is another challenge for wireless communication, both because the devices tend to be battery powered and because antennas radiate power to communicate and little of it reaches the receiver. As a result, raw bit error rates are typically a thousand to a million times higher than copper wire.

> 更具挑战性。第二个挑战是无线信号不受保护，因此受到相互干扰，尤其是随着设备的移动。电源是无线通信的另一个挑战，这既是因为设备倾向于电池供电，并且天线辐射了通信的电源，而且几乎没有接收器。结果，原始位错误率通常比铜线高 100 万倍。

There are two primary architectures for wireless networks: _base station_ archi- tectures and _peer-to-peer_ architectures. Base stations are connected by landlines for longer-distance communication, and the mobile units communicate only with a single local base station. Peer-to-peer architectures allow mobile units to commu- nicate with each other, and messages hop from one unit to the next until delivered to the desired unit. Although peer-to-peer is more reconfigurable, base stations tend to be more reliable since there is only one hop between the device and the station. _Cellular telephony_, the most popular example of wireless networks, relies on radio with base stations.

> 无线网络有两个主要体系结构：_Base Station_ Archi-Archi-tocer_-peer-to-peer_架构。基站通过座机连接以进行更长的距离通信，而移动设备仅与一个本地基站进行通信。点对点体系结构允许移动单元相互通信，并且消息从一个单元跳到另一个单元，直到传递到所需的单元为止。尽管点对点更具重新配置，但基站往往更可靠，因为设备和电台之间只有一个跳跃。_细胞电话_是无线网络的最流行示例，它依赖于基本站的广播。

Cellular systems exploit exponential path loss to reuse the same frequency at spatially separated locations, thereby greatly increasing the number of customers served. Cellular systems will divide a city into nonoverlapping hexagonal cells that use different frequencies if nearby, reusing a frequency only when cells are far enough apart so that mutual interference is acceptable.

> 蜂窝系统利用指数路径损失以在空间分离的位置重复使用相同的频率，从而大大增加了服务的客户数量。蜂窝系统将将城市分为非重叠的六角形细胞，如果附近，则使用不同的频率，只有在细胞足够远时才能重复使用频率，因此可以接受相互干扰。

At the intersection of three hexagonal cells is a base station with transmitters and antennas that is connected to a switching office that coordinates handoffs when a mobile device leaves one cell and goes into another, as well as accepts and places calls over landlines. Depending on topography, population, and so on, the radius of a typical cell is 2 to 10 miles.

> 在三个六角形细胞的交点上，是一个基站，带有发射机和天线，该基站连接到交换处，当移动设备离开一个单元并进入另一个单元时，可以协调交换，并接受和接听地线上的电话。根据地形，人口等，典型电池的半径为 2 至 10 英里。

[Figure E.15](#_bookmark590) shows the components of a radio, which is the heart of a cell phone. Radio signals are first received by the antenna, amplified, passed through a mixer, then filtered, demodulated, and finally decoded. The antenna acts as the interface between the medium through which radio waves travel and the electronics of the transmitter or receiver. Antennas can be designed to work best in particular direc- tions, giving both transmission and reception directional properties. Modulation encodes information in the amplitude, phase, or frequency of the signal to increase its robustness under impaired conditions. Radio transmitters go through the same steps, just in the opposite order.

> [图 E.15]（#_ bookmark590）显示了无线电的组件，这是手机的核心。电台信号首先是由天线收到的，放大，通过混合器，然后过滤，解调并最终解码。天线充当无线电波传播的介质与发射器或接收器的电子设备之间的界面。天线可以设计为特殊的方向最佳，具有传输和接收方向性的特性。调制在信号的幅度，相或频率中编码信息，以增加其在受损条件下的鲁棒性。无线电发射机以相反的顺序通过相同的步骤。

Originally, all components were analog, but over time most were replaced by digital components, requiring the radio signal to be converted from analog to dig- ital. The desire for flexibility in the number of radio bands led to software routines replacing some of these functions in programmable chips, such as digital signal processors. Because such processors are typically found in mobile devices, empha- sis is placed on performance per joule to extend battery life, performance per square millimeter of silicon to reduce size and cost, and bytes per task to reduce memory size.

> 最初，所有组件都是模拟的，但是随着时间的流逝，大多数组件被数字组件替换，要求无线电信号从模拟转换为挖掘。对无线电频段数量的灵活性的渴望导致软件例程取代了可编程芯片中的一些功能，例如数字信号处理器。由于通常在移动设备中发现了此类处理器，因此将其施加在每焦耳的性能上，以延长电池寿命，每平方毫米的硅每平方毫米的性能，以降低尺寸和成本，以及每项任务的字节，以减少记忆尺寸。

Figure E.15 A radio receiver consists of an antenna, radio frequency amplifier, mixer, filters, demodulator, and decoder. A mixer accepts two signal inputs and forms an out- put signal at the sum and difference frequencies. Filters select a narrower band of fre- quencies to pass on to the next stage. Modulation encodes information to make it more robust. Decoding turns signals into information. Depending on the application, all elec- trical components can be either analog or digital. For example, a car radio is all analog components, but a PC modem is all digital except for the amplifier. Today analog silicon chips are used for the RF amplifier and first mixer in cellular phones.

> 图 E.15 无线电接收器由天线，射频放大器，混合器，过滤器，解调器和解码器组成。混合器接受两个信号输入，并以总和和差异频率形成外部信号。过滤器选择一个更狭窄的频率乐队以传递到下一阶段。调制编码信息以使其更强大。解码将信号变成信息。根据应用程序，所有电子组件都可以是模拟或数字组件。例如，汽车收音机都是所有模拟组件，但是 PC 调制解调器除了放大器之外都是数字化的。如今，模拟硅芯片用于 RF 放大器和细胞手机中的第一混合器。

[Figure E.16](#_bookmark591) shows the generic block diagram of the electronics of a cell phone handset, with the DSP performing the signal processing and the microcontroller handling the rest of the tasks. Cell phone handsets are basically mobile computers acting as a radio. They include standard I/O devices—keyboard and LCD dis- play—plus a microphone, speaker, and antenna for wireless networking. Battery efficiency affects sales, both for standby power when waiting for a call and for minutes of speaking.

> [图 E.16]（#_ bookmark591）显示了手机手机电子设备的通用框图，而 DSP 执行信号处理，而微控制器处理其余任务。手机手机基本上是充当无线电的移动计算机。它们包括标准的 I/O 设备 - 钥匙板和 LCD 播放 - 以及用于无线网络的麦克风，扬声器和天线。电池效率会影响销售，既要等待通话，又是备用电源。

When a cell phone is turned on, the first task is to find a cell. It scans the full bandwidth to find the strongest signal, which it keeps doing every seven seconds or if the signal strength drops, since it is designed to work from moving vehicles. It then picks an unused radio channel. The local switching office registers the cell phone and records its phone number and electronic serial number, and assigns it a voice channel for the phone conversation. To be sure the cell phone got the right channel, the base station sends a special tone on it, which the cell phone sends back to acknowledge it. The cell phone times out after 5 seconds if it doesn’t hear the super- visory tone, and it starts the process all over again. The original base station makes a handoff request to the incoming base station as the signal strength drops offs.

> 打开手机时，第一个任务是找到一个单元。它扫描了完整的带宽以找到最强的信号，该信号每七秒钟一次，或者信号强度下降，因为它旨在从移动车辆中工作。然后，它选择了一个未使用的无线电频道。本地交换办公室注册了手机并记录其电话号码和电子序列号，并为电话对话分配了语音频道。为了确保手机获得正确的频道，基站在其上发送了一种特殊的音调，手机将其发送回去以确认它。5 秒钟后，手机段出来了，如果听不到超级视觉音调，并且它重新开始了该过程。当信号强度下降时，原始的基站向来源的基站提出了交接请求。

To achieve a two-way conversation over radio, frequency bands are set aside for each direction, forming a frequency pair or _channel._ The original cellular base stations transmitted at 869.04 to 893.97 MHz (called the _forward path_), and cell phones transmitted at 824.04 to 848.97 MHz (called t*he reverse path*), with the frequency gap to keep them from interfering with each other. Cells might have had between 4 and 80 channels. Channels were divided into setup channels for call setup and voice channels to handle the data or voice traffic.

> 为了通过无线电进行双向对话，为每个方向搁置了频带，形成频段或_CHANNEL。824.04 至 848.97 MHz（称为 T*Reverse Path*），并带有频率间隙，以防止它们相互干扰。细胞可能有 4 到 80 个通道。将通道分为呼叫设置和语音频道的设置通道，以处理数据或语音流量。

The communication is done digitally, just like a modem, at 9600 bits/sec. Since wireless is a lossy medium, especially from a moving vehicle, the handset sends each message five times. To preserve battery life, the original cell phones typically transmit at two signal strengths—0.6 W and 3.0 W—depending on the distance to the cell. This relatively low power not only allows smaller batteries and thus smal- ler cell phones, but it also aids frequency reuse, which is the key to cellular telephony.

> 通信是在 9600 位/秒的数字上进行以数字方式进行的。由于无线是一种有损的媒介，尤其是从移动的车辆中，手机将每条消息发送五次。为了保留电池寿命，原始手机通常以两个信号强度传输-0.6 W 和 3.0 W-在距离电池的距离上延伸。这种相对较低的功率不仅允许较小的电池，因此可以使用手机，而且还有助于频率重复使用，这是蜂窝电话的关键。

[Figure E.17](#_bookmark592) shows a circuit board from a Nokia digital phone, with the com- ponents identified. Note that the board contains two processors. A Z-80 microcon- troller is responsible for controlling the functions of the board, I/O with the keyboard and display, and coordinating with the base station. The DSP handles all signal compression and decompression. In addition there are dedicated chips for analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion, amplifiers, power manage- ment, and RF interfaces.

> [图 E.17]（#_ bookmark592）显示了诺基亚数字手机的电路板，并确定了该电路。请注意，董事会包含两个处理器。Z-80 微型拖钓者负责控制板的功能，键盘和显示器 I/O，并与基站协调。DSP 处理所有信号压缩和减压。此外，还有专门的芯片，用于模数到数字和数字转换转换，放大器，电源管理和 RF 接口。

In 2001, a cell phone had about 10 integrated circuits, including parts made in exotic technologies like gallium arsinide and silicon germanium as well as standard CMOS. The economics and desire for flexibility have shrunk this to just a few chips. However, these SOCs still contain a separate microcontroller and DSP, with code implementing many of the functions just described.

> 2001 年，一部手机有大约 10 个集成电路，包括用艾西替尼德和硅锗等外来技术制造的零件以及标准的 CMOS。对灵活性的经济学和渴望仅缩小了几筹。但是，这些 SOC 仍然包含一个单独的微控制器和 DSP，代码实现了许多刚刚描述的功能。

### Cell Phone Standards and Evolution

> ###手机标准和进化

Improved communication speeds for cell phones were developed with multiple standards. _Code division multiple access_ (CDMA), as one popular example, uses a wider radio frequency band for a path than the original cell phones, called _advanced mobile phone service_ (AMPS), a mostly analog system. The wider fre- quency makes it more difficult to block and is called _spread spectrum._ Other stan- dards are *time division multiple acces*s (TDMA) and _global system for mobile communication_ (GSM). These second-generation standards—CDMA, GSM, and TDMA—are mostly digital.

> 用多个标准开发了手机的通信速度提高。_code Division Muttern Access_（CDMA）作为一个流行的示例，它使用一个更宽的射频频带作为路径，而不是原始手机，称为_Advanced 手机服务_（AMPS），这是一个大多数模拟系统。更广泛的频率使其更难阻止，并称为_spread Spectrum。这些第二代标准（CDMA，GSM 和 TDMA）主要是数字化的。

The big difference for CDMA is that all callers share the same channel, which operates at a much higher rate, and it then distinguishes the different calls by encoding each one uniquely. Each CDMA phone call starts at 9600 bits/sec; it is then encoded and transmitted as equal-sized messages at 1.25 Mbits/sec. Rather than send each signal five times as in AMPS, each bit is stretched so that it takes 11 times the minimum frequency, thereby accommodating interference and yet suc- cessful transmission. The base station receives the messages, and it separates them into the separate 9600 bit/sec streams for each call.

> CDMA 的最大区别在于，所有呼叫者共享相同的频道，该通道以更高的速率运行，然后通过独特地编码每个呼叫来区分不同的调用。每个 CDMA 电话的开始为 9600 位/秒；然后将其编码为 1.25 MBITS/sec 的同等消息。与 AMP 中的每个信号一样，每个位都拉伸，而不是将每个信号发送到最小频率的 11 倍，从而可以容纳干扰且成功的传输。基站接收消息，并将它们分为每个呼叫的单独的 9600 位/秒流。

To enhance privacy, CDMA uses pseudorandom sequences from a set of 64 predefined codes. To synchronize the handset and base station so as to pick a com- mon pseudorandom seed, CDMA relies on a clock from the Global Positioning System, which continuously transmits an accurate time signal. By carefully select- ing the codes, the shared traffic sounds like random noise to the listener. Hence, as more users share a channel there is more noise, and the signal-to-noise ratio grad- ually degrades. Thus, the capacity of the CDMA system is a matter of taste, depending upon the sensitivity of the listener to background noise.

> 为了增强隐私性，CDMA 使用了一组 64 个预定义代码的伪随机序列。为了同步听筒和基站以选择伪烷种子，CDMA 依赖于全局定位系统的时钟，该系统连续传输准确的时间信号。通过仔细选择代码，共享的流量听起来像是随机的噪声。因此，随着越来越多的用户共享一个频道，噪音更多，信噪比的逐渐降低。因此，根据听众对背景噪声的敏感性，CDMA 系统的容量是一种口味问题。

In addition, CDMA uses speech compression and varies the rate of data trans- ferred depending upon how much activity is going on in the call. Both these tech- niques preserve bandwidth, which allows for more calls per cell. CDMA must regulate power carefully so that signals near the cell tower do not overwhelm those from far away, with the goal of all signals reaching the tower at about the same level. The side benefit is that CDMA handsets emit less power, which both helps battery life and increases capacity when users are close to the tower.

> 此外，CDMA 使用语音压缩，并根据调用中的活动进行了多少不同的数据传输速率。这两种技术都保留了带宽，它允许每个单元格更多。CDMA 必须仔细调节电源，以便细胞塔附近的信号不会压倒远处的信号，所有信号的目标都在大约相同的水平到达塔。侧面好处是，CDMA 手机发出的功率更少，当用户靠近塔楼时，这既可以帮助电池寿命，又可以增加容量。

Thus, compared to AMPS, CDMA improves the capacity of a system by up to an order of magnitude, has better call quality, has better battery life, and enhances users’ privacy. After considerable commercial turmoil, there is a new third- generation standard called _International Mobile Telephony 2000_ (IMT-2000), based primarily on two competing versions of CDMA and one TDMA. This stan- dard may lead to cell phones that work anywhere in the world.

> 因此，与 AMPS 相比，CDMA 最多可以提高系统的容量，最多可提高呼叫质量，具有更好的电池寿命并增强用户的隐私。经过大量商业动荡之后，有一个新的第三代标准，称为_ International 移动电话 2000_（IMT-2000），主要基于 CDMA 和一个 TDMA 的两个竞争版本。这种标准可能会导致手机在世界任何地方工作。
