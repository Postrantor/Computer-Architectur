The popularity of Internet services such as search engines and auctions has enhanced the importance of I/O for computers, since no one would want a desktop computer that couldn’t access the Internet. This rise in importance of I/O is reflected by the names of our times. The 1960s to 1980s were called the Computing Revolution; the period since 1990 has been called the Information Age, with concerns focused on advances in information technology versus raw computa- tional power. Internet services depend upon massive storage, which is the focus of this chapter, and networking, which is the focus of [Appendix F](#_bookmark595).

This shift in focus from computation to communication and storage of infor- mation emphasizes reliability and scalability as well as cost-performance. Although it is frustrating when a program crashes, people become hysterical if they lose their data; hence, storage systems are typically held to a higher standard of dependability than the rest of the computer. Dependability is the bedrock of storage, yet it also has its own rich performance theory—queuing theory—that balances throughput versus response time. The software that determines which processor features get used is the compiler, but the operating system usurps that role for storage.

> 从计算到信息的通信和存储的这种转变强调了可靠性和可扩展性以及成本绩效。尽管当计划崩溃时令人沮丧，但如果失去数据，人们就会变得歇斯底里。因此，与计算机的其余部分相比，存储系统通常保持更高的可靠性标准。可靠性是存储的基岩，但它也具有其自身的丰富性能理论(何种表现理论)，即平衡吞吐量与响应时间。确定使用哪种处理器功能的软件是编译器，但是操作系统篡夺该效果以存储。

Thus, storage has a different, multifaceted culture from processors, yet it is still found within the architecture tent. We start our exploration with advances in mag- netic disks, as they are the dominant storage device today in desktop and server computers. We assume that readers are already familiar with the basics of storage devices, some of which were covered in [Chapter 1](#_bookmark2).

> 因此，存储与处理器具有不同的多面文化，但在建筑帐篷中仍然可以找到它。我们从磁盘上的进步开始探索，因为它们是当今台式机和服务器计算机中的主要存储设备。我们假设读者已经熟悉存储设备的基础知识，其中一些已在[第 1 章](#_ bookmark2)中介绍。
