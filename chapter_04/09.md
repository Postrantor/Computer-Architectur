## Concluding Remarks

Data-level parallelism is increasing in importance for personal mobile devices, given the popularity of applications showing the importance of audio, video, and games on these devices. When combined with a model that is easier to program than task-level parallelism and with potentially better energy efficiency, it’s easy to see why there has been a renaissance for data-level parallelism in this decade.

We are seeing system processors take on more of the characteristics of GPUs, and vice versa. One of the biggest differences in performance between conven- tional processors and GPUs has been for gather-scatter addressing. Traditional vec- tor architectures show how to add such addressing to SIMD instructions, and we expect to see more ideas added from the well-proven vector architectures to SIMD extensions over time.

> 我们看到系统处理器具有更多 GPU 的特征，反之亦然。召开处理器和 GPU 之间的性能最大差异之一是用于聚集筛选。传统的 vector 体系结构显示了如何在 SIMD 说明中添加此类地址，我们希望看到良好的矢量体系结构中添加了更多想法，以随着时间的推移以 SIMD 扩展。

As we said in the opening of [Section 4.4](#graphics-processing-units), the GPU question is not simply which architecture is best, but given the hardware investment to do graphics well, how can it be enhanced to support computation that is more general? Although vector architectures have many advantages on paper, it remains to be proven whether vec- tor architectures can be as good a foundation for graphics as GPUs. RISC-V has embraced vector over SIMD. Thus, like architecture debates of the past, the mar- ketplace will help determine the importance of the strengths and weaknesses of two styles of data parallel architectures.

> 正如我们在[第 4.4 节](＃Graphics Processing-units)的开放中所说的那样，GPU 问题不仅是哪种体系结构是最好的，而且考虑到硬件投资可以很好地进行图形，如何增强以支持计算该计算更一般吗？尽管矢量体系结构在纸面上具有许多优势，但尚待证明，vector 架构是否可以像 GPU 一样成为图形的良好基础。RISC-V 已在 SIMD 上接受了矢量。因此，像过去的架构辩论一样，Mar-Ketplace 将有助于确定两种数据并行体系结构的优势和劣势的重要性。
