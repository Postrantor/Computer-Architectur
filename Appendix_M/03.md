### The First General-Purpose Electronic Computers

J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the Moore School of the University of Pennsylvania built the world’s first fully operational electronic general-purpose computer. This machine, called ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator), was funded by the U.S. Army and became operational during World War II, but it was not publicly disclosed until 1946. ENIAC was used for comput- ing artillery firing tables. The machine was enormous—100 feet long, 8½ feet high, and several feet wide. Each of the 20 ten-digit registers was 2 feet long. In total, there were 18,000 vacuum tubes.

> 宾夕法尼亚大学摩尔学院的 J. Presper Eckert 和 John Mauchly 建造了世界上第一台完全可操作的电子通用计算机。这台名为 ENIAC(电子数字积分器和计算器)的机器由美国陆军资助，并在第二次世界大战期间投入使用，但直到 1946 年才公开披露。ENIAC 用于计算火炮射击表。这台机器非常庞大——长 100 英尺，高 8.5 英尺，宽几英尺。20 个十位数寄存器中的每一个都有 2 英尺长。总共有 18,000 个真空管。

Although the size was three orders of magnitude bigger than the size of the average machines built today, it was more than five orders of magnitude slower, with an add taking 200 microseconds. The ENIAC provided conditional jumps and was programmable, which clearly distinguished it from earlier calculators. Programming was done manually by plugging up cables and setting switches and required from a half hour to a whole day. Data were provided on punched cards. The ENIAC was limited primarily by a small amount of storage and tedious programming.

> 虽然它的尺寸比今天制造的普通机器的尺寸大三个数量级，但速度却慢了五个数量级以上，加法需要 200 微秒。ENIAC 提供条件跳转并且是可编程的，这使它与早期的计算器明显不同。编程是通过插入电缆和设置开关手动完成的，需要半小时到一整天。数据在穿孔卡片上提供。ENIAC 的主要限制是存储量小和编程繁琐。

In 1944, John von Neumann was attracted to the ENIAC project. The group wanted to improve the way programs were entered and discussed storing programs as numbers; von Neumann helped crystallize the ideas and wrote a memo proposing a stored-program computer called EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer). Herman Goldstine distributed the memo and put von Neu- mann’s name on it, much to the dismay of Eckert and Mauchly, whose names were omitted. This memo has served as the basis for the commonly used term `von Neumann computer`. Several early inventors in the computer field believe that this term gives too much credit to von Neumann, who conceptualized and wrote up the ideas, and too little to the engineers, Eckert and Mauchly, who worked on the machines. Like most historians, your authors (winners of the 2000 IEEE von Neumann Medal) believe that all three individuals played a key role in developing the stored-program computer. Von Neumann’s role in writing up the ideas, in gen- eralizing them, and in thinking about the programming aspects was critical in trans- ferring the ideas to a wider audience.

> 1944 年，约翰·冯·诺依曼 (John von Neumann) 被 ENIAC 项目所吸引。该小组希望改进程序的输入方式，并讨论了将程序存储为数字的方式；冯·诺依曼帮助使想法具体化，并写了一份备忘录，提出了一种名为 EDVAC(电子离散变量自动计算机)的存储程序计算机。Herman Goldstine 分发了备忘录，并在上面写上了 von Neumann 的名字，这让 Eckert 和 Mauchly 非常沮丧，他们的名字被省略了。这份备忘录已成为常用术语 "冯诺依曼计算机" 的基础。计算机领域的几位早期发明家认为，这个术语过多地归功于冯诺依曼，他将这些想法概念化并写下来，而对**从事机器工作的工程师 Eckert 和 Mauchly 的归功太少**。像大多数历史学家一样，您的作者(2000 年 IEEE 冯·诺依曼奖章获得者)相信这三个人在开发存储程序计算机方面都发挥了关键作用。冯·诺依曼在撰写想法、概括想法以及思考编程方面的作用对于将想法传递给更广泛的受众至关重要。

In 1946, Maurice Wilkes of Cambridge University visited the Moore School to attend the latter part of a series of lectures on developments in electronic com- puters. When he returned to Cambridge, Wilkes decided to embark on a project to build a stored-program computer named EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator). (The EDSAC used mercury delay lines for its memory; hence, the phrase "delay storage" in its name.) The EDSAC became operational in 1949 and was the world’s first full-scale, operational, stored-program computer [Wilkes, Wheeler, and Gill 1951; Wilkes 1985, 1995]. (A small prototype called the Mark I, which was built at the University of Manchester and ran in 1948, might be called the first operational stored-program machine.) The EDSAC was an accumulator-based architecture. This style of instruction set architecture remained popular until the early 1970s. ([Appendix A](#_bookmark391) starts with a brief summary of the EDSAC instruction set.)

> 1946 年，剑桥大学的莫里斯·威尔克斯 (Maurice Wilkes) 访问了摩尔学院，参加了一系列关于电子计算机发展的讲座的后半部分。回到剑桥后，威尔克斯决定着手构建一台名为 EDSAC(电子延迟存储自动计算器)的存储程序计算机。(EDSAC 在其存储器中使用水银延迟线；因此，其名称中有 "延迟存储" 一词。)EDSAC 于 1949 年开始运行，是世界上第一台全尺寸、可运行的存储程序计算机 [Wilkes, Wheeler, 和吉尔 1951 年；威尔克斯 1985 年，1995 年]。(在曼彻斯特大学建造并于 1948 年运行的名为 Mark I 的小型原型机可能被称为第一台可运行的存储程序机器。)EDSAC 是一种基于累加器的架构。这种指令集架构风格一直流行到 20 世纪 70 年代初。([附录 A](#_bookmark391) 以 EDSAC 指令集的简要总结开始。)

In 1947, Mauchly took the time to help found the Association for Computing Machinery. He served as the ACM’s first vice-president and second president. That same year, Eckert and Mauchly applied for a patent on electronic computers. The dean of the Moore School, by demanding that the patent be turned over to the university, may have helped Eckert and Mauchly conclude that they should leave. Their departure crippled the EDVAC project, which did not become operational until 1952.

> 1947 年，莫奇利花时间帮助成立了计算机协会。他曾担任 ACM 第一副主席和第二任主席。同年，埃克特和莫奇利申请了电子计算机专利。摩尔学院院长要求将专利移交给大学，这可能帮助埃克特和莫奇利得出了他们应该离开的结论。他们的离开削弱了 EDVAC 项目，该项目直到 1952 年才开始运作。

Goldstine left to join von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 1946. Together with Arthur Burks, they issued a report based on the 1944 memo [Burks, Goldstine, and von Neumann 1946]. The paper led to the IAS machine built by Julian Bigelow at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study. It had a total of 1024 40-bit words and was roughly 10 times faster than ENIAC. The group thought about uses for the machine, published a set of reports, and encouraged visitors. These reports and visitors inspired the development of a number of new computers, including the first IBM computer, the 701, which was based on the IAS machine. The paper by Burks, Goldstine, and von Neumann was incredible for the period. Reading it today, you would never guess this landmark paper was written more than 50 years ago, as most of the architectural concepts seen in modern computers are discussed there (e.g., see the quote at the beginning of [Chapter 2](#_bookmark46)).

> Goldstine 于 1946 年离开普林斯顿高等研究院加入 von Neumann。他们与 Arthur Burks 一起根据 1944 年的备忘录发表了一份报告 [Burks, Goldstine, and von Neumann 1946]。这篇论文促成了普林斯顿高等研究院的朱利安·毕格罗 (Julian Bigelow) 建造的 IAS 机器。它总共有 1024 个 40 位字，大约比 ENIAC 快 10 倍。该小组考虑了机器的用途，发布了一组报告，并鼓励访客。这些报告和来访者激发了许多新计算机的开发，包括第一台基于 IAS 机器的 IBM 计算机 701。Burks、Goldstine 和 von Neumann 的论文在那个时期是不可思议的。今天读它，你绝不会猜到这篇具有里程碑意义的论文是在 50 多年前写的，因为那里讨论了现代计算机中的大多数架构概念(例如，参见 [第 2 章](#_bookmark46) 开头的引述 ).

In the same time period as ENIAC, Howard Aiken was designing an electro- mechanical computer called the Mark-I at Harvard. The Mark-I was built by a team of engineers from IBM. He followed the Mark-I with a relay machine, the Mark-II, and a pair of vacuum tube machines, the Mark-III and Mark-IV. The Mark-III and Mark-IV were built after the first stored-program machines. Because they had separate memories for instructions and data, the machines were regarded as reactionary by the advocates of stored-program computers. The term _Harvard architecture_ was coined to describe this type of machine. Though clearly different from the original sense, this term is used today to apply to machines with a single main memory but with separate instruction and data caches.

> 与 ENIAC 处于同一时期，Howard Aiken 正在哈佛大学设计一台名为 Mark-I 的机电计算机。Mark-I 由 IBM 的一组工程师打造。在 Mark-I 之后，他又推出了一台中继机 Mark-II，以及一对真空管机 Mark-III 和 Mark-IV。Mark-III 和 Mark-IV 是在第一台存储程序机器之后建造的。因为它们有独立的指令和数据存储器，所以这些机器被存储程序计算机的拥护者视为反动。_Harvard architecture_ 一词就是用来描述这种类型的机器的。虽然与原来的含义明显不同，但该术语今天用于指代具有单个主存储器但具有独立指令和数据高速缓存的机器。

The Whirlwind project [Redmond and Smith 1980] began at MIT in 1947 and was aimed at applications in real-time radar signal processing. Although it led to several inventions, its overwhelming innovation was the creation of magnetic core memory, the first reliable and inexpensive memory technology. Whirlwind had 2048 16-bit words of magnetic core. Magnetic cores served as the main memory technology for nearly 30 years.

> Whirlwind 项目 [Redmond and Smith 1980] 于 1947 年在麻省理工学院开始，旨在实时雷达信号处理中的应用。尽管它带来了多项发明，但其压倒性的创新是磁芯存储器的发明，这是第一种可靠且廉价的存储器技术。Whirlwind 有 2048 个 16 位字的磁芯。磁芯作为主要的存储技术已有近 30 年的历史。

### Important Special-Purpose Machines

During World War II, major computing efforts in both Great Britain and the United States focused on special-purpose code-breaking computers. The work in Great Britain was aimed at decrypting messages encoded with the German Enigma coding machine. This work, which occurred at a location called Bletchley Park, led to two important machines. The first, an electromechanical machine, conceived of by Alan Turing, was called BOMB [see Good in Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota 1980]. The second, much larger and electronic machine, conceived and designed by Newman and Flowers, was called COLOSSUS [see Randall in Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota 1980]. These were highly specialized cryptanalysis machines, which played a vital role in the war by providing the ability to read coded messages, especially those sent to U-boats. The work at Bletchley Park was highly classified (indeed, some of it is still classified), so its direct impact on the development of ENIAC, EDSAC, and other computers is difficult to trace, but it certainly had an indirect effect in advancing the technology and gaining understanding of the issues.

> 在第二次世界大战期间，英国和美国的主要计算工作都集中在专用密码破译计算机上。英国的工作旨在解密用德国恩尼格玛编码机编码的信息。这项工作发生在一个叫做布莱切利公园的地方，导致了两台重要的机器。第一个是机电机器，由 Alan Turing 构思，称为 BOMB [参见 Metropolis、Howlett 和 Rota 1980 中的 Good]。第二台更大的电子机器，由 Newman 和 Flowers 构思和设计，被称为 COLOSSUS [见 Randall in Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota 1980]。这些是高度专业化的密码分析机器，通过提供读取编码信息的能力在战争中发挥了至关重要的作用，尤其是那些发送给 U 型潜艇的信息。Bletchley Park 的工作是高度机密的(实际上，其中一些仍然是机密)，因此它对 ENIAC、EDSAC 和其他计算机的发展的直接影响很难追踪，但它肯定对推进技术产生了间接影响 并获得对问题的理解。

Similar work on special-purpose computers for cryptanalysis went on in the United States. The most direct descendent of this effort was the company Engineer- ing Research Associates (ERA) [see Thomash in Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota 1980], which was founded after the war to attempt to commercialize on the key ideas. ERA built several machines that were sold to secret government agencies, and it was eventually purchased by Sperry-Rand, which had earlier purchased the Eckert Mauchly Computer Corporation.

> 在用于密码分析的专用计算机上，类似的工作在美国进行。这项努力的最直接后代是工程研究协会 (ERA) 公司 [参见 Metropolis、Howlett 和 Rota 1980 中的 Thomash]，该公司是在战后成立的，旨在将关键思想商业化。ERA 制造了几台机器，卖给了秘密政府机构，它最终被 Sperry-Rand 收购，后者之前收购了 Eckert Mauchly Computer Corporation。

Another early set of machines that deserves credit was a group of special- purpose machines built by Konrad Zuse in Germany in the late 1930s and early 1940s [see Bauer and Zuse in Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota 1980]. In addition to producing an operating machine, Zuse was the first to implement floating point, which von Neumann claimed was unnecessary! His early machines used a mechanical store that was smaller than other electromechanical solutions of the time. His last machine was electromechanical but, because of the war, was never completed.

> 另一组值得称赞的早期机器是 1930 年代末和 40 年代初德国 Konrad Zuse 制造的一组专用机器 [参见 Bauer and Zuse in Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota 1980]。楚思除了制造了一台运行机器，还是第一个实现了浮点数的，冯·诺依曼声称这是不必要的！ 他的早期机器使用的机械商店比当时的其他机电解决方案小。他的最后一台机器是机电式的，但由于战争，从未完成。

An important early contributor to the development of electronic computers was John Atanasoff, who built a small-scale electronic computer in the early 1940s [Ata- nasoff 1940]. His machine, designed at Iowa State University, was a special-purpose computer (called the ABC, for Atanasoff Berry Computer) that was never completely operational. Mauchly briefly visited Atanasoff before he built ENIAC, and several of Atanasoff’s ideas (e.g., using binary representation) likely influenced Mauchly. The presence of the Atanasoff machine, delays in filing the ENIAC pat- ents (the work was classified, and patents could not be filed until after the war), and the distribution of von Neumann’s EDVAC paper were used to break the Eckert– Mauchly patent [Larson 1973]. Though controversy still rages over Atanasoff’s role, Eckert and Mauchly are usually given credit for building the first working, general-purpose, electronic computer [Stern 1980]. Atanasoff, however, demon- strated several important innovations included in later computers. Atanasoff deserves much credit for his work, and he might fairly be given credit for the world’s first special-purpose electronic computer and for possibly influencing Eckert and Mauchly.

> 约翰·阿塔纳索夫 (John Atanasoff) 是电子计算机发展的重要早期贡献者，他在 1940 年代初期制造了一台小型电子计算机 [Atanasoff 1940]。他的机器是在爱荷华州立大学设计的，是一台从未完全运行过的专用计算机(称为 ABC，代表 Atanasoff Berry Computer)。在创建 ENIAC 之前，Mauchly 曾短暂拜访过 Atanasoff，Atanasoff 的一些想法(例如，使用二进制表示法)可能影响了 Mauchly。阿塔纳索夫机器的出现、ENIAC 专利申请的延迟(该工作被保密，战后才能申请专利)以及冯诺依曼 EDVAC 论文的分发被用来打破 Eckert-Mauchly 专利 [拉森 1973]。尽管关于 Atanasoff 的角色仍然存在争议，但 Eckert 和 Mauchly 通常因建造第一台可工作的通用电子计算机而受到赞誉 [Stern 1980]。然而，阿塔纳索夫展示了包括在后来的计算机中的几项重要创新。阿塔纳索夫的工作值得赞扬，他可能因世界上第一台专用电子计算机以及可能对埃克特和莫奇利产生的影响而受到赞扬。

### Commercial Developments

In December 1947, Eckert and Mauchly formed Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation. Their first machine, the BINAC, was built for Northrop and was shown in August 1949. After some financial difficulties, the Eckert-Mauchly Com- puter Corporation was acquired by Remington-Rand, later called Sperry-Rand. Sperry-Rand merged the Eckert-Mauchly acquisition, ERA, and its tabulating business to form a dedicated computer division, called UNIVAC. UNIVAC deliv- ered its first computer, the UNIVAC I, in June 1951. The UNIVAC I sold for $250,000 and was the first successful commercial computer—48 systems were built! Today, this early machine, along with many other fascinating pieces of com- puter lore, can be seen at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. Other places where early computing systems can be visited include the Deutsches Museum in Munich and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., as well as numerous online virtual museums.

> 1947 年 12 月，埃克特和莫奇利成立了埃克特-莫奇利计算机公司。他们的第一台机器 BINAC 是为诺斯罗普制造的，并于 1949 年 8 月展示。在经历了一些财务困难之后，Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation 被 Remington-Rand(后来称为 Sperry-Rand)收购。Sperry-Rand 合并了 Eckert-Mauchly 收购的 ERA 及其制表业务，形成了一个专门的计算机部门，称为 UNIVAC。UNIVAC 于 1951 年 6 月交付了第一台计算机 UNIVAC I。UNIVAC I 以 250,000 美元的价格售出，是第一台成功的商用计算机——共制造了 48 个系统！ 今天，这台早期的机器连同许多其他令人着迷的计算机知识作品，都可以在加利福尼亚州山景城的计算机历史博物馆中看到。可以访问早期计算系统的其他地方包括慕尼黑的德意志博物馆和华盛顿特区的史密森学会，以及众多在线虚拟博物馆。

IBM, which earlier had been in the punched card and office automation busi- ness, didn’t start building computers until 1950. The first IBM computer, the IBM 701 based on von Neumann’s IAS machine, shipped in 1952 and eventually sold 19 units [see Hurd in Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota 1980]. In the early 1950s, many people were pessimistic about the future of computers, believing that the market and opportunities for these "highly specialized" machines were quite lim- ited. Nonetheless, IBM quickly became the most successful computer company. Their focus on reliability and customer- and market-driven strategies were key. Although the 701 and 702 were modest successes, IBM’s follow-up machines, the 650, 704, and 705 (delivered in 1954 and 1955) were significant successes, each selling from 132 to 1800 computers.

> IBM 之前一直从事穿孔卡和办公自动化业务，直到 1950 年才开始制造计算机。第一台 IBM 计算机，即基于冯诺依曼 IAS 机器的 IBM 701，于 1952 年发货，最终售出 19 台 [ 参见 Hurd in Metropolis、Howlett 和 Rota 1980]。在 20 世纪 50 年代初期，许多人对计算机的未来持悲观态度，认为这些 "高度专业化" 机器的市场和机会十分有限。尽管如此，IBM 很快成为最成功的计算机公司。他们对可靠性以及以客户和市场为导向的战略的关注是关键。尽管 701 和 702 取得了一定的成功，但 IBM 的后续机器 650、704 和 705(分别于 1954 年和 1955 年交付)取得了重大成功，每台计算机的销量从 132 台到 1800 台不等。

Several books describing the early days of computing have been written by the pioneers [Goldstine 1972; Wilkes 1985, 1995], as well as Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota [1980], which is a collection of recollections by early pioneers. There are numerous independent histories, often built around the people involved [Slater 1987], as well as a journal, _Annals of the History of Computing_, devoted to the history of computing.

> 先驱们已经写了几本描述早期计算的书 [Goldstine 1972；Wilkes 1985, 1995]，以及 Metropolis、Howlett 和 Rota [1980]，这是早期开拓者的回忆录。有许多独立的历史，通常围绕相关人员建立[Slater 1987]，还有一本期刊，_Annals of the History of Computing_，专门介绍计算的历史。

### Development of Quantitative Performance Measures: Successes and Failures

In the earliest days of computing, designers set performance goals—ENIAC was to be 1000 times faster than the Harvard Mark-I, and the IBM Stretch (7030) was to be 100 times faster than the fastest machine in existence. What wasn’t clear, though, was how this performance was to be measured. In looking back over the years, it is a consistent theme that each generation of computers obsoletes the performance evaluation techniques of the prior generation.

> 在计算的早期，设计人员设定了性能目标——ENIAC 比 Harvard Mark-I 快 1000 倍，而 IBM Stretch (7030) 比现有最快的机器快 100 倍。然而，不清楚的是如何衡量这种表现。回顾这些年，**每一代计算机都淘汰了上一代的性能评估技术**，这是一个始终如一的主题。

The original measure of performance was time to perform an individual oper- ation, such as addition. Since most instructions took the same execution time, the timing of one gave insight into the others. As the execution times of instructions in a machine became more diverse, however, the time for one operation was no longer useful for comparisons. To take these differences into account, an _instruction mix_ was calculated by measuring the relative frequency of instructions in a computer across many programs. The Gibson mix [Gibson 1970] was an early popular instruction mix. Multiplying the time for each instruction times its weight in the mix gave the user the _average instruction execution time_. (If measured in clock cycles, average instruction execution time is the same as average cycles per instruc- tion.) Since instruction sets were similar, this was a more accurate comparison than add times. From average instruction execution time, then, it was only a small step to MIPS (as we have seen, the one is the inverse of the other). MIPS had the virtue of being easy for the layperson to understand.

> 最初的性能衡量标准是执行单个操作(例如加法)的时间。由于大多数指令的执行时间相同，因此一条指令的时间安排可以深入了解其他指令。然而，随着机器中指令的执行时间变得更加多样化，一个操作的时间不再可用于比较。为了将这些差异考虑在内，"指令组合" 是通过测量计算机中指令在许多程序中的相对频率来计算的。Gibson mix [Gibson 1970] 是早期流行的指令组合。将每条指令的时间乘以其在混合中的权重，即可为用户提供*平均指令执行时间*。(如果以时钟周期衡量，平均指令执行时间与每条指令的平均周期相同。)由于指令集相似，因此这是比加法时间更准确的比较。那么，从平均指令执行时间来看，它只是向 MIPS 迈出了一小步(正如我们所见，一个是另一个的倒数)。MIPS 具有易于外行理解的优点。

As CPUs became more sophisticated and relied on memory hierarchies and pipelining, there was no longer a single execution time per instruction; MIPS could not be calculated from the mix and the manual. The next step was benchmarking using kernels and synthetic programs. Curnow and Wichmann [1976] created the Whetstone synthetic program by measuring scientific programs written in Algol 60\. This program was converted to FORTRAN and was widely used to character- ize scientific program performance. An effort with similar goals to Whetstone, the Livermore FORTRAN Kernels, was made by McMahon [1986] and researchers at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in an attempt to establish a benchmark for super- computers. These kernels, however, consisted of loops from real programs.

> 随着 CPU 变得越来越复杂并依赖于内存层次结构和流水线，每条指令不再有单一的执行时间；无法从混合和手册中计算 MIPS。下一步是使用内核和合成程序进行基准测试。Curnow 和 Wichmann [1976] 通过测量用 Algol 60 编写的科学程序创建了 Whetstone 合成程序。该程序被转换为 FORTRAN 并被广泛用于表征科学程序的性能。McMahon [1986] 和 Lawrence Livermore 实验室的研究人员做出了与 Whetstone(Livermore FORTRAN 内核)类似目标的努力，试图建立超级计算机的基准。然而，这些内核由来自真实程序的循环组成。

As it became clear that using MIPS to compare architectures with different instruction sets would not work, a notion of relative MIPS was created. When the VAX-11/780 was ready for announcement in 1977, DEC ran small benchmarks that were also run on an IBM 370/158. IBM marketing referred to the 370/158 as a 1 MIPS computer, and, because the programs ran at the same speed, DEC market- ing called the VAX-11/780 a 1 MIPS computer. Relative MIPS for a machine M was defined based on some reference machine as:

> 由于使用 MIPS 来比较具有不同指令集的架构是行不通的，因此创建了相对 MIPS 的概念。当 VAX-11/780 于 1977 年准备发布时，DEC 运行了同样在 IBM 370/158 上运行的小型基准测试。IBM 营销部门将 370/158 称为 1 MIPS 计算机，并且由于程序以相同速度运行，DEC 营销部门将 VAX-11/780 称为 1 MIPS 计算机。机器 M 的相对 MIPS 是基于一些参考机器定义为：

The popularity of the VAX-11/780 made it a popular reference machine for relative MIPS, especially since relative MIPS for a 1 MIPS computer is easy to calculate: If a machine was five times faster than the VAX-11/780, for that benchmark its rating would be 5 relative MIPS. The 1 MIPS rating was unquestioned for 4 years, until Joel Emer of DEC measured the VAX-11/780 under a time-sharing load. He found that the VAX-11/780 native MIPS rating was 0.5. Subsequent VAXes that ran 3 native MIPS for some benchmarks were therefore called 6 MIPS machines because they ran six times faster than the VAX-11/780. By the early 1980s, the term _MIPS_ was almost universally used to mean relative MIPS.

> VAX-11/780 的流行使其成为相对 MIPS 的流行参考机，特别是因为 1 MIPS 计算机的相对 MIPS 很容易计算：如果一台机器比 VAX-11/780 快五倍，那么 基准其评级将是 5 相对 MIPS。1 MIPS 评级在 4 年内都没有受到质疑，直到 DEC 的 Joel Emer 在分时负载下测量 VAX-11/780。他发现 VAX-11/780 的原生 MIPS 等级是 0.5。因此，对于某些基准测试运行 3 个本机 MIPS 的后续 VAX 被称为 6 MIPS 机器，因为它们的运行速度是 VAX-11/780 的六倍。到 80 年代初期，_MIPS_ 一词几乎普遍用于表示相对 MIPS。

The 1970s and 1980s marked the growth of the supercomputer industry, which was defined by high performance on floating-point-intensive programs. Average instruction time and MIPS were clearly inappropriate metrics for this industry, hence the invention of MFLOPS (millions of floating-point operations per second), which effectively measured the inverse of execution time for a bench- mark. Unfortunately, customers quickly forget the program used for the rating, and marketing groups decided to start quoting peak MFLOPS in the supercomputer performance wars.

> 70 年代和 80 年代标志着超级计算机行业的发展，其定义是浮点密集型程序的高性能。平均指令时间和 MIPS 显然不适合该行业，因此发明了 MFLOPS(每秒百万次浮点运算)，它有效地衡量了基准执行时间的倒数。不幸的是，客户很快就忘记了用于评级的程序，营销团队决定在超级计算机性能大战中开始引用峰值 MFLOPS。

SPEC (System Performance and Evaluation Cooperative) was founded in the late 1980s to try to improve the state of benchmarking and make a more valid basis for comparison. The group initially focused on workstations and servers in the UNIX marketplace, and these remain the primary focus of these benchmarks today. The first release of SPEC benchmarks, now called SPEC89, was a substantial improvement in the use of more realistic benchmarks. SPEC2006 still dominates processor benchmarks almost two decades later.

> SPEC(System Performance and Evaluation Cooperative)成立于 20 世纪 80 年代后期，旨在改善基准测试的状态，并为比较提供更有效的基础。该小组最初专注于 UNIX 市场中的工作站和服务器，这些仍然是当今这些基准测试的主要关注点。SPEC 基准测试的第一个版本，现在称为 SPEC89，是在使用更现实的基准测试方面的重大改进。近二十年后，SPEC2006 仍然主导着处理器基准测试。
