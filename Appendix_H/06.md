## Concluding Remarks

When the design of the IA-64 architecture began, it was a joint effort of Hewlett- Packard and Intel and many of the designers had benefited from experience with early VLIW processors as well of years of research building on the early concepts. The clear goal for the IA-64 architecture was to achieve levels of ILP as good or better than what had been achieved with hardware-based approaches, while also allowing a much simpler hardware implementation. With a simpler hardware implementation, designers hoped that much higher clock rates could be achieved. Indeed, when the IA-64 architecture and the first Itanium were announced, they were announced as the successor to the RISC approaches with clearly superior advantages.

> 当 IA-64 架构的设计开始时，这是惠普和英特尔的共同努力，许多设计师都从早期 VLIW 处理器的经验以及关于早期概念的多年研究建设中受益。IA-64 体系结构的明确目标是与基于硬件的方法相比，达到 ILP 的水平，同时还可以实现更简单的硬件实现。通过更简单的硬件实现，设计师希望可以实现更高的时钟速率。的确，当宣布 IA-64 架构和第一个 ITANIUM 时，他们被宣布为 RISC 方法的继任者，显然是优势。

Unfortunately, the practical reality has been quite different. The IA-64 and Ita- nium implementations appear to be at least as complicated as the dynamically based speculative processors, and neither approach has a significant and consistent performance advantage. The fact that the Itanium designs have also not been more power efficient has led to a situation where the Itanium design has been adopted by only a small number of customers primarily interested in FP performance.

> 不幸的是，实践现实是完全不同的。IA-64 和 ITANIUM 实现似乎至少与基于动态的投机处理器一样复杂，并且方法都没有显着且一致的性能优势。Itanium 设计也没有更高效的事实导致了这样一种情况，即仅由主要对 FP 性能感兴趣的少数客户采用了 Itanium 设计。

Intel had planned for IA-64 to be its new 64-bit architecture as well. But the combination of its mediocre integer performance (especially in Itanium 1) and large die size, together with AMD’s introduction of a 64-bit version of the IA- 32 architecture, forced Intel to extend the address space of IA-32. The availability of a larger address space IA-32 processor with strong integer performance has fur- ther reduced the interest in IA-64 and Itanium. Most recently, Intel has introduced the name IPF to replace IA-64, since the former name made less sense once the older x86 architecture was extended to 64 bits.

> 英特尔还计划将 IA-64 成为其新的 64 位架构。但是，其平庸的整数性能(尤其是在 Itanium 1 中)和大尺寸的结合，以及 AMD 介绍了 64 位版本的 IA-32 架构，迫使英特尔扩展了 IA-32 的地址空间。较大的地址空间 IA-32 处理器具有强大的整数性能降低了对 IA-64 和 ITANIUM 的兴趣。最近，英特尔引入了 IPF 的名称来替换 IA-64，因为一旦将旧的 X86 架构扩展到 64 位，前一个名称就不太合理。
