## Embedded Multiprocessors

Multiprocessors are now common in server environments, and several desktop multiprocessors are available from vendors, such as Sun, Compaq, and Apple. In the embedded space, a number of special-purpose designs have used customized multiprocessors, including the Sony PlayStation 2 (see Section E.5).

Many special-purpose embedded designs consist of a general-purpose pro- grammable processor or DSP with special-purpose, finite-state machines that are used for stream-oriented I/O. In applications ranging from computer graphics and media processing to telecommunications, this style of special-purpose multi- processor is becoming common. Although the interprocessor interactions in such designs are highly regimented and relatively simple—consisting primarily of a simple communication channel—because much of the design is committed to sil- icon, ensuring that the communication protocols among the input/output proces- sors and the general-purpose processor are correct is a major challenge in such designs.

More recently, we have seen the first appearance, in the embedded space, of embedded multiprocessors built from several general-purpose processors. These multiprocessors have been focused primarily on the high-end telecommunications and networking market, where scalability is critical. An example of such a design is the MXP processor designed by empowerTel Networks for use in voice-over-IP systems. The MXP processor consists of four main components:

- An interface to serial voice streams, including support for handling jitter
- Support for fast packet routing and channel lookup
- A complete Ethernet interface, including the MAC layer
- Four MIPS32 R4000-class processors, each with its own cache (a total of 48 KB or 12 KB per processor)

The MIPS processors are used to run the code responsible for maintaining the voice-over-IP channels, including the assurance of quality of service, echo cancel- lation, simple compression, and packet encoding. Since the goal is to run as many independent voice streams as possible, a multiprocessor is an ideal solution.

Because of the small size of the MIPS cores, the entire chip takes only 13.5 M transistors. Future generations of the chip are expected to handle more voice chan- nels, as well as do more sophisticated echo cancellation, voice activity detection, and more sophisticated compression.

Multiprocessing is becoming widespread in the embedded computing arena for two primary reasons. First, the issues of binary software compatibility, which pla- gue desktop and server systems, are less relevant in the embedded space. Often software in an embedded application is written from scratch for an application or significantly modified (note that this is also the reason VLIW is favored over superscalar in embedded instruction-level parallelism). Second, the applications often have natural parallelism, especially at the high end of the embedded space. Examples of this natural parallelism abound in applications such as a settop box, a network switch, a cell phone (see Section E.7) or a game system (see Section E.5). The lower barriers to use of thread-level parallelism together with the greater sen- sitivity to die cost (and hence efficient use of silicon) are leading to widespread adoption of multiprocessing in the embedded space, as the application needs grow to demand more performance.

> 由于两个主要原因，多处理在嵌入式计算领域变得越来越普遍。首先，困扰桌面和服务器系统的二进制软件兼容性问题在嵌入式领域的相关性较低。嵌入式应用程序中的软件通常是为应用程序从头开始编写或经过重大修改(请注意，这也是 VLIW 在嵌入式指令级并行性中优于超标量的原因)。其次，应用程序通常具有天然的并行性，尤其是在嵌入式空间的高端。这种自然并行性的例子在机顶盒、网络交换机、手机(见 E.7 节)或游戏系统(见 E.5 节)等应用中比比皆是。使用线程级并行性的较低障碍以及对裸片成本的更高敏感性(以及因此有效地使用硅)导致嵌入式空间中广泛采用多处理，因为应用程序需要增长以需要更高的性能。
