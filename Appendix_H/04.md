## Hardware Support for Compiler Speculation

> ##编译器投机的硬件支持

As we saw in [Chapter 3](#_bookmark93), many programs have branches that can be accurately pre- dicted at compile time either from the program structure or by using a profile. In such cases, the compiler may want to speculate either to improve the scheduling or to increase the issue rate. Predicated instructions provide one method to speculate, but they are really more useful when control dependences can be completely elim- inated by if conversion. In many cases, we would like to move speculated instruc- tions not only before the branch but also before the condition evaluation, and predication cannot achieve this.

> 正如我们在[第 3 章]（#_ bookmark93）中看到的那样，许多程序都有可以在程序结构或使用配置文件中准确预定的分支。在这种情况下，编译器可能希望推测提高计划率或提高发行率。预测指令提供了一种推测方法，但是当可以通过 IF 转换完全消除控制依赖时，它们确实更有用。在许多情况下，我们不仅要在分支机构之前，而且在条件评估之前进行推测的指导，而且谓词无法实现这一目标。

To speculate ambitiously requires three capabilities:

> 为了推测有雄心勃勃的需要三个功能：

1. The ability of the compiler to find instructions that, with the possible use of reg- ister renaming, can be speculatively moved and not affect the program data flow

> 1.编译器能够找到指令的能力，这些说明可能会使用重命名的重命名，可以进行推测，并且不会影响程序数据流

2. The ability to ignore exceptions in speculated instructions, until we know that such exceptions should really occur

> 2.在推测说明中忽略异常的能力，直到我们知道这种例外应该发生

3. The ability to speculatively interchange loads and stores, or stores and stores, which may have address conflicts

> 3.投机互换负载和存储或商店和商店的能力，可能有解决冲突

The first of these is a compiler capability, while the last two require hardware sup- port, which we explore next.

> 第一个是编译器功能，而最后两个需要硬件支持，我们接下来要探索。

### Hardware Support for Preserving Exception Behavior

> ###硬件支持保存异常行为

To speculate ambitiously, we must be able to move any type of instruction and still preserve its exception behavior. The key to being able to do this is to observe that the results of a speculated sequence that is mispredicted will not be used in the final computation, and such a speculated instruction should not cause an exception.

> 为了雄心勃勃，我们必须能够移动任何类型的指令并仍然保留其异常行为。能够做到这一点的关键是要观察到最终计算中不使用错误预测的序列的结果，并且这种推测的指令不应导致例外。

There are four methods that have been investigated for supporting more ambi- tious speculation without introducing erroneous exception behavior:

> 已经研究了四种方法，用于支持更多的狂热猜测，而没有引入错误的例外行为：

1. The hardware and operating system cooperatively ignore exceptions for spec- ulative instructions. As we will see later, this approach preserves exception behavior for correct programs, but not for incorrect ones. This approach may be viewed as unacceptable for some programs, but it has been used, under pro- gram control, as a “fast mode” in several processors.

> 1.硬件和操作系统合作忽略了针对特定说明的例外。正如我们稍后将看到的那样，这种方法保留了正确程序的异常行为，但不能保留错误的程序。对于某些程序，可以将这种方法视为不可接受，但是在范围控制下，它已被用作几个处理器中的“快速模式”。

2. Speculative instructions that never raise exceptions are used, and checks are introduced to determine when an exception should occur.

> 2.使用永不提高例外的投机说明，并引入检查以确定何时应发生异常。

3. A set of status bits, called _poison bits_, are attached to the result registers written by speculated instructions when the instructions cause exceptions. The poison bits cause a fault when a normal instruction attempts to use the register.

> 3.当指令导致例外时，将一组称为_poison bits_的状态位连接到由推测指令编写的结果寄存器。当正常的指令试图使用寄存器时，毒物位会导致故障。

4. A mechanism is provided to indicate that an instruction is speculative, and the hardware buffers the instruction result until it is certain that the instruction is no longer speculative.

> 4.提供了一种机制来表明指令是投机性的，并且硬件缓冲指令结果，直到确定指令不再是投机性的。

To explain these schemes, we need to distinguish between exceptions that indi- cate a program error and would normally cause termination, such as a memory pro- tection violation, and those that are handled and normally resumed, such as a page fault. Exceptions that can be resumed can be accepted and processed for specula- tive instructions just as if they were normal instructions. If the speculative instruc- tion should not have been executed, handling the unneeded exception may have some negative performance effects, but it cannot cause incorrect execution. The cost of these exceptions may be high, however, and some processors use hardware support to avoid taking such exceptions, just as processors with hardware specu- lation may take some exceptions in speculative mode, while avoiding others until an instruction is known not to be speculative.

> 为了解释这些方案，我们需要区分有指示程序错误并通常会导致终止的例外，例如记忆违反记忆的违规行为，以及那些处理和正常恢复的情况，例如页面故障。可以恢复的例外可以被接受并处理以进行猜测说明，就像它们是正常说明一样。如果不应执行投机性的指导，则处理不需要的例外可能会产生一些负面效果，但不会导致执行不正确。但是，这些例外的成本可能很高，有些处理器使用硬件支持来避免采取此类例外，就像具有硬件指定的处理器可能在投机模式下采取一些例外，同时避免其他人，直到已知指令不为人投机性。

Exceptions that indicate a program error should not occur in correct programs, and the result of a program that gets such an exception is not well defined, except perhaps when the program is running in a debugging mode. If such exceptions arise in speculated instructions, we cannot take the exception until we know that the instruction is no longer speculative.

> 表明程序错误不应在正确的程序中不应发生的例外，并且程序的结果不能很好地定义，除非程序在调试模式下运行。如果在推测说明中出现了这种例外，则在我们知道指令不再投机之前，我们不能采取异常。

In the simplest method for preserving exceptions, the hardware and the oper- ating system simply handle all resumable exceptions when the exception occurs and simply return an undefined value for any exception that would cause termina- tion. If the instruction generating the terminating exception was not speculative, then the program is in error. Note that instead of terminating the program, the program is allowed to continue, although it will almost certainly generate incorrect results. If the instruction generating the terminating exception is speculative, then the program may be correct and the speculative result will simply be unused; thus, returning an undefined value for the instruction cannot be harmful. This scheme can never cause a correct program to fail, no matter how much speculation is done. An incorrect program, which formerly might have received a terminating excep- tion, will get an incorrect result. This is acceptable for some programs, assuming the compiler can also generate a normal version of the program, which does not speculate and can receive a terminating exception.

> 在保留异常的最简单方法中，硬件和操作系统只需在发生异常时处理所有可重新删除异常，然后简单地返回未定义的值，即任何会导致终止的异常。如果生成终止异常的指令不是投机性的，则该程序是错误的。请注意，尽管它几乎肯定会产生不正确的结果，但允许该程序继续进行，而不是终止程序。如果产生终止异常的指令是推测性的，则该程序可能是正确的，并且投机性结果将简单未使用；因此，为指令返回不确定的价值不能有害。无论猜测有多少猜测，该方案永远不会导致正确的程序失败。一个不正确的程序以前可能已经收到终止的表现，将获得不正确的结果。对于某些程序来说，这是可以接受的，假设编译器还可以生成该程序的正常版本，该程序不会推测并可以接收终止异常。

Example Consider that the following code fragment from an if-then-else statement of the form

> 示例考虑以下代码片段来自该表单的 if-then-else 语句

```

> ````````

if (A==0)A= B; else A= A+4;

> ````````

Assume that the then clause is _almost always_ executed. Compile the code using compiler-based speculation. Assume R14 is unused and available.

> 假设当时的子句是_lymast 始终执行。使用基于编译器的推测来编译代码。假设 R14 未使用并且可用。

Answer Here is the new code:

> 答案是新代码：

The then clause is completely speculated. We introduce a temporary register to avoid destroying R1 when B is loaded; if the load is speculative, R14 will be use- less. After the entire code segment is executed, A will be in R14. The else clause could have also been compiled speculatively with a conditional move, but if the branch is highly predictable and low cost, this might slow the code down, since two extra instructions would always be executed as opposed to one branch.

> 当时的子句是完全推测的。我们引入一个临时寄存器，以避免在加载 B 时销毁 R1；如果负载是投机性的，则 R14 将不再使用。执行整个代码段后，A 将在 R14 中。其他条款也可以通过有条件的举动进行投机，但是如果分支高度可预测且成本低，则可能会减慢代码的速度，因为始终将执行两个额外的说明而不是一个分支。

In such a scheme, it is not necessary to know that an instruction is speculative. Indeed, it is helpful only when a program is in error and receives a terminating exception on a normal instruction; in such cases, if the instruction were not marked as speculative, the program could be terminated.

> 在这样的方案中，不必知道指令是投机性的。实际上，只有在程序中出错并在正常指令上获得终止异常时，才有帮助；在这种情况下，如果未将指令标记为投机性，则可以终止该计划。

In this method for handling speculation, as in the next one, renaming will often be needed to prevent speculative instructions from destroying live values. Renam- ing is usually restricted to register values. Because of this restriction, the targets of stores cannot be destroyed and stores cannot be speculative. The small number of registers and the cost of spilling will act as one constraint on the amount of spec- ulation. Of course, the major constraint remains the cost of executing speculative instructions when the compiler’s branch prediction is incorrect.

> 在处理猜测的方法中，与下一个猜测一样，通常需要重命名以防止投机说明破坏实时价值。重命名通常仅限于寄存器值。由于这种限制，商店的目标不能被破坏，商店不能投机。少量注册表和溢出成本将是对规格数量的限制。当然，当编译器的分支预测不正确时，主要限制仍然是执行投机说明的成本。

A second approach to preserving exception behavior when speculating intro- duces speculative versions of instructions that do not generate terminating excep- tions and instructions to check for such exceptions. This combination preserves the exception behavior exactly.

> 推测引入性的指令的投机版本时，可以保留异常行为的第二种方法，这些版本不会生成终止的征收和指令以检查此类例外。这种组合完全保留了例外行为。

Example Show how the previous example can be coded using a speculative load (sLD) and a speculation check instruction (SPECCK) to completely preserve exception behav- ior. Assume R14 is unused and available.

> 示例说明如何使用投机载荷（SLD）和投机检查指令（SPECCK）对上一个示例进行编码，以完全保留异常行为。假设 R14 未使用并且可用。

_Answer_ Here is the code that achieves this:

> _answer_这是实现这一目标的代码：

Notice that the speculation check requires that we maintain a basic block for the then case. If we had speculated only a portion of the then case, then a basic block representing the then case would exist in any event. More importantly, notice that checking for a possible exception requires extra code.

> 请注意，投机检查要求我们为当时的情况维护一个基本块。如果我们仅推测了当时的情况的一部分，则在任何事件中都存在代表当时情况的基本块。更重要的是，请注意，检查可能的例外需要额外的代码。

A third approach for preserving exception behavior tracks exceptions as they occur but postpones any terminating exception until a value is actually used, pre- serving the occurrence of the exception, although not in a completely precise fash- ion. The scheme is simple: A poison bit is added to every register, and another bit is added to every instruction to indicate whether the instruction is speculative. The poison bit of the destination register is set whenever a speculative instruction results in a terminating exception; all other exceptions are handled immediately. If a speculative instruction uses a register with a poison bit turned on, the destina- tion register of the instruction simply has its poison bit turned on. If a normal instruction attempts to use a register source with its poison bit turned on, the instruction causes a fault. In this way, any program that would have generated an exception still generates one, albeit at the first instance where a result is used by an instruction that is not speculative. Since poison bits exist only on register values and not memory values, stores are never speculative and thus trap if either operand is “poison.”

> 保留异常行为的第三种方法会跟踪异常发生，但是将任何终止异常推迟到实际使用一个值之前，预先为异常的发生，尽管不是完全精确的效果。该方案很简单：每个寄存器都添加了一个毒位，并将另一个位添加到每个指令中，以指示指令是否投机。每当投机指令导致终止异常时，设置目标寄存器的毒物位；所有其他例外都立即处理。如果投机指令使用带有毒位的登记册，则指令的命令寄存器简单地打开了毒物位。如果正常的指令试图使用毒位打开的寄存器源，则该说明会导致故障。这样，任何本来会生成一个例外的程序仍然会生成一个程序，尽管在一开始就使用了不推测性的指令使用结果。由于毒物位仅存在于寄存器值而不是记忆值上，因此商店永远不会投机，因此如果任何操作数都是“毒药”，则陷阱。

Example Consider the code fragment from page H-29 and show how it would be compiled with speculative instructions and poison bits. Show where an exception for the speculative memory reference would be recognized. Assume R14 is unused and available.

> 示例考虑第 H-29 页的代码片段，并显示如何使用投机性说明和毒物碎片进行编译。显示在识别投机记忆参考的例外情况下。假设 R14 未使用并且可用。

_Answer_ Here is the code (an s preceding the opcode indicates a speculative instruction):

> _answer_这是代码（opcode 之前的一个 S 表示投机指令）：

> ===

If the speculative sLD generates a terminating exception, the poison bit of R14 will be turned on. When the nonspeculative SW instruction occurs, it will raise an exception if the poison bit for R14 is on.

> 如果投机性 SLD 产生终止异常，则将打开 R14 的毒物位。当出现非负责 SW 指令时，如果 R14 的毒物位启动，它将引起例外。

One complication that must be overcome is how the OS saves the user registers on a context switch if the poison bit is set. A special instruction is needed to save and reset the state of the poison bits to avoid this problem.

> 必须克服的一个复杂性是，如果设置了毒物位，则操作系统如何保存用户寄存器在上下文开关上。需要特殊的指导来保存和重置毒物位的状态，以避免此问题。

The fourth and final approach listed earlier relies on a hardware mechanism that operates like a reorder buffer. In such an approach, instructions are marked by the compiler as speculative and include an indicator of how many branches the instruction was speculatively moved across and what branch action (taken/ not taken) the compiler assumed. This last piece of information basically tells the hardware the location of the code block where the speculated instruction orig- inally was. In practice, most of the benefit of speculation is gained by allowing movement across a single branch; thus, only 1 bit saying whether the speculated instruction came from the taken or not taken path is required. Alternatively, the original location of the speculative instruction is marked by a _sentinel_, which tells the hardware that the earlier speculative instruction is no longer speculative and values may be committed.

> 前面列出的第四种也是最后的方法依赖于像重新订购缓冲区一样运行的硬件机制。在这种方法中，指令由编译器标记为投机性，并包括指示该指令进行了多少分支的指标，以及编译器假定的分支机构（采取/未采取）。最后一条信息基本上告诉硬件代码块的位置，该指示指令原始所在。实际上，通过允许跨越一个分支的运动来获得大多数猜测的好处。因此，只有 1 位说明指令是否来自采取的路径。或者，投机指令的原始位置由_sentinel_标记，该词告诉硬件，早期的投机指令不再是投机性的，并且可以提交值。

All instructions are placed in a reorder buffer when issued and are forced to commit in order, as in a hardware speculation approach. (Notice, though, that no actual speculative branch prediction or dynamic scheduling occurs.) The reor- der buffer tracks when instructions are ready to commit and delays the “write- back” portion of any speculative instruction. Speculative instructions are not allowed to commit until the branches that have been speculatively moved over are also ready to commit, or, alternatively, until the corresponding sentinel is reached. At that point, we know whether the speculated instruction should have been executed or not. If it should have been executed and it generated a terminating exception, then we know that the program should be terminated. If the instruction should not have been executed, then the exception can be ignored. Notice that the compiler, rather than the hardware, has the job of register renaming to ensure cor- rect usage of the speculated result, as well as correct program execution.

> 发出时，所有说明都置于重新订购缓冲区中，并被迫按顺序提交，例如在硬件投机方法中。（但是请注意，没有发生实际投机分支预测或动态调度。）当指令准备提交并延迟任何投机指令的“写入”部分时，重新缓冲轨道会轨道。在投机移动的分支机构也准备提交之前，或者在达到相应的哨兵之前，不允许投机说明提交。那时，我们知道是否应该执行推测指令。如果应该执行并生成终止异常，那么我们知道该程序应终止。如果指令不应执行，则可以忽略异常。请注意，编译器而不是硬件具有重命名的工作，以确保对推测结果的使用以及正确的程序执行。

### Hardware Support for Memory Reference Speculation

> ###硬件支持用于内存参考猜测

Moving loads across stores is usually done when the compiler is certain the addresses do not conflict. As we saw with the examples in Section 3.2, such trans- formations are critical to reducing the critical path length of a code segment. To allow the compiler to undertake such code motion when it cannot be absolutely certain that such a movement is correct, a special instruction to check for address conflicts can be included in the architecture. The special instruction is left at the original location of the load instruction (and acts like a guardian), and the load is moved up across one or more stores.

> 当编译器是确定地址不会发生冲突时，通常会在商店中移动负载。正如我们在第 3.2 节中的示例中看到的那样，这种转移对于降低代码段的临界路径长度至关重要。为了允许编译器在不能绝对确定此类动作是正确的情况下进行此类代码运动，可以在体系结构中包含一个特殊的指导来检查地址冲突。特殊说明留在负载指令的原始位置（并像监护人一样），并且负载在一个或多个商店中移动。

When a speculated load is executed, the hardware saves the address of the accessed memory location. If a subsequent store changes the location before the check instruction, then the speculation has failed. If the location has not been touched, then the speculation is successful. Speculation failure can be handled in two ways. If only the load instruction was speculated, then it suffices to redo the load at the point of the check instruction (which could supply the target register in addition to the memory address). If additional instructions that depended on the load were also speculated, then a fix-up sequence that reexecutes all the speculated instructions starting with the load is needed. In this case, the check instruction specifies the address where the fix-up code is located.

> 执行推测的负载后，硬件保存了访问的内存位置的地址。如果后续存储在检查指令之前更改位置，则猜测失败了。如果该位置尚未触及，则猜测是成功的。猜测失败可以通过两种方式处理。如果仅推测了负载指令，则足以在检查指令点重新载入负载（可以在存储器地址附加其他目标寄存器）。如果还猜测了依赖负载的其他说明，则需要重新执行所有从负载开始的推测指令的固定序列。在这种情况下，检查指令指定固定代码所在的地址。

In this section, we have seen a variety of hardware assist mechanisms. Such mechanisms are key to achieving good support with the compiler-intensive approaches of [Chapter 3](#_bookmark93) and this appendix. In addition, several of them can be eas- ily integrated in the hardware-intensive approaches of [Chapter 3](#_bookmark93) and provide addi- tional benefits.

> 在本节中，我们看到了各种硬件辅助机制。这种机制是通过[第 3 章]（#_ bookmark93）和此附录的编译器密集型方法获得良好支持的关键。此外，其中几个可以在[第 3 章]（#_ bookmark93）的硬件密集型方法中进行综合，并提供添加优势。
