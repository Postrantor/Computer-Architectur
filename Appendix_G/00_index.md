I’m certainly not inventing vector processors. There are three kinds that I know of existing today. They are represented by the Illiac-IV, the (CDC) Star processor, and the TI (ASC) processor. Those three were all pioneering processors.…One of the problems of being a pioneer is you always make mistakes and I never, never want to be a pioneer. It’s always best to come second when you can look at the mistakes the pioneers made.
