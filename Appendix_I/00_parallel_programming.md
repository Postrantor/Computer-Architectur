Hennessy and Patterson should move MPPs to Chapter 11.
Jim Gray, Microsoft Research
_when asked about the coverage of massively parallel processors_
_(MPPs) for the third edition in 2000_
_Unfortunately for companies in the MPP business, the third edition had only ten chapters and the MPP business did not grow as anticipated when the first and second edition were written._
