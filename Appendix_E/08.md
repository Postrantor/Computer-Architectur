## Concluding Remarks

Embedded systems are a very broad category of computing devices. This appendix has shown just some aspects of this. For example, the TI 320C55 DSP is a rela- tively "RISC-like" processor designed for embedded applications, with very fine-tuned capabilities. On the other end of the spectrum, the TI 320C64x is a very high-performance, eight-issue VLIW processor for very demanding tasks. Some processors must operate on battery power alone; others have the luxury of being plugged into line current. Unifying all of these is a need to perform some level of signal processing for embedded applications. Media extensions attempt to merge DSPs with some more general-purpose processing abilities to make these proces- sors usable for signal processing applications. We examined several case studies, including the Sony PlayStation 2, digital cameras, and cell phones. The PS2 per- forms detailed three-dimensional graphics, whereas a cell phone encodes and decodes signals according to elaborate communication standards. But both have system architectures that are very different from general-purpose desktop or server platforms. In general, architectural decisions that seem practical for general- purpose applications, such as multiple levels of caching or out-of-order superscalar execution, are much less desirable in embedded applications. This is due to chip area, cost, power, and real-time constraints. The programming model that these systems present places more demands on both the programmer and the compiler for extracting parallelism.

> 嵌入式系统是一类非常广泛的计算设备。本附录仅展示了这方面的某些方面。例如，TI 320C55 DSP 是一种相对 "类 RISC" 的处理器，专为嵌入式应用而设计，具有非常精细的功能。在频谱的另一端，TI 320C64x 是一款非常高性能的八发射 VLIW 处理器，适用于非常苛刻的任务。一些处理器必须单独使用电池供电；其他人有被插入线路电流的奢侈。统一所有这些是为嵌入式应用程序执行某种级别的信号处理的需要。媒体扩展试图将 DSP 与一些更通用的处理能力相结合，使这些处理器可用于信号处理应用。我们研究了几个案例研究，包括索尼 PlayStation 2、数码相机和手机。PS2 执行详细的三维图形，而手机根据复杂的通信标准对信号进行编码和解码。但两者都具有与通用桌面或服务器平台截然不同的系统架构。一般来说，对于通用应用程序来说似乎实用的架构决策，例如多级缓存或无序超标量执行，在嵌入式应用程序中不太受欢迎。这是由于芯片面积、成本、功率和实时限制。这些系统呈现的编程模型对程序员和编译器都提出了更多要求，以提取并行性。
