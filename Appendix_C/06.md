### RISC Instruction Sets and Efficiency of Pipelining

> ### RISC 指令集和管道效率

We have already discussed the advantages of instruction set simplicity in building pipelines. Simple instruction sets offer another advantage: they make it easier to schedule code to achieve efficiency of execution in a pipeline. To see this, con- sider a simple example: suppose we need to add two values in memory and store the result back to memory. In some sophisticated instruction sets this will take only a single instruction; in others, it will take two or three. A typical RISC archi- tecture would require four instructions (two loads, an add, and a store). These instructions cannot be scheduled sequentially in most pipelines without interven- ing stalls.

> 我们已经讨论了教学设置简单性在构建管道中的优势。简单的指令集提供了另一个优点：它们使安排代码更容易在管道中实现执行效率。要查看这一点，请考虑一个简单的示例：假设我们需要在内存中添加两个值并将结果存储回存储。在某些复杂的指令集中，这只会仅需一个指令。在其他情况下，这将需要两三个。一个典型的 Risc 档案将需要四个说明(两个负载，一个添加和一个商店)。如果没有干预摊位，这些说明不能在大多数管道中依次安排。

With a RISC instruction set, the individual operations are separate instructions and may be individually scheduled either by the compiler (using the techniques we discussed earlier and more powerful techniques discussed in [Chapter 3](#_bookmark93)) or using dynamic hardware scheduling techniques (which we discuss next and in further detail in [Chapter 3](#_bookmark93)). These efficiency advantages, coupled with the greater ease of implementation, appear to be so significant that almost all recent pipelined implementations of complex instruction sets actually translate their complex instructions into simple RISC-like operations, and then schedule and pipeline those operations. All recent Intel processors use this approach, and it is also used in ARM processors for some of the more complex instructions.

> 使用 RISC 指令集，单个操作是单独的指令，可以由编译器单独安排(使用我们之前讨论过的技术以及[第 3 章](#_ bookmark93)中讨论的更强大的技术)或使用动态硬件调度技术(我们在[第 3 章](#_ bookmark93)中进行下一个以及进一步的详细讨论。这些效率优势，加上更大的实施，似乎是如此重要，以至于几乎所有最近的复杂指令集的管道实现实际上都将其复杂的指令转化为简单的类似 RISC 的操作，然后将这些操作安排和管道和管道。所有最近的英特尔处理器都使用这种方法，并且在 ARM 处理器中也用于一些更复杂的说明。

### Dynamically Scheduled Pipelines

> ###动态计划的管道

Simple pipelines fetch an instruction and issue it, unless there is a data dependence between an instruction already in the pipeline and the fetched instruction that can- not be hidden with bypassing or forwarding. Forwarding logic reduces the effec- tive pipeline latency so that certain dependences do not result in hazards. If there is an unavoidable hazard, then the hazard detection hardware stalls the pipeline (start- ing with the instruction that uses the result). No new instructions are fetched or issued until the dependence is cleared. To overcome these performance losses, the compiler can attempt to schedule instructions to avoid the hazard; this approach is called _compiler_ or _static scheduling_.

> 简单的管道获取指令并发行它，除非管道中已经存在指令与所取的指令之间存在数据依赖性，而这些指令可能不会绕过或转发。转发逻辑会减少效率管道潜伏期，从而使某些依赖性不会导致危险。如果存在不可避免的危险，则危害检测硬件会导致管道(从使用结果的指令开始)。在清除依赖性之前，没有获取或发出新的说明。为了克服这些绩效损失，编译器可以尝试安排说明以避免危险；此方法称为_compiler_或_static Scheduling_。

Several early processors used another approach, called _dynamic scheduling_, whereby the hardware rearranges the instruction execution to reduce the stalls. This section offers a simpler introduction to dynamic scheduling by explaining the scor- eboarding technique of the CDC 6600. Some readers will find it easier to read this material before plunging into the more complicated Tomasulo scheme, and the speculation approaches that extend it, both of which are covered in [Chapter 3](#_bookmark93).

> 几个早期处理器使用了另一种方法，称为_DYNAMIC 调度_，因此硬件重新安排了指令执行以减少失速。本节通过解释 CDC 6600 的计分板技术来提供更简单的动态调度介绍。有些读者会发现在陷入更复杂的 tomasulo 方案之前，会发现更容易阅读此材料，并且扩展了这种猜测方法，这两种方法都将其扩展到它，这两种方法都是两者[第 3 章](#_ bookmark93)涵盖。

All the techniques discussed in this appendix so far use in-order instruction issue, which means that if an instruction is stalled in the pipeline, no later instruc- tions can proceed. With in-order issue, if two instructions have a hazard between them, the pipeline will stall, even if there are later instructions that are independent and would not stall.

> 到目前为止，本附录中讨论的所有技术都使用固定指令问题，这意味着，如果说明在管道中停滞不前，则不再需要进行工程。在固定问题上，如果两个说明之间有危险，那么管道也会停滞，即使以后有独立的说明且不会停滞。

In the RISC V pipeline developed earlier, both structural and data hazards were checked during instruction decode (ID): when an instruction could execute properly, it was issued from ID. To allow an instruction to begin execution as soon as its oper- ands are available, even if a predecessor is stalled, we must separate the issue process into two parts: checking the structural hazards and waiting for the absence of a data hazard. We decode and issue instructions in order; however, we want the instructions to begin execution as soon as their data operands are available. Thus, the pipeline will do _out-of-order execution_, which implies _out-of-order completion_. To implement out-of-order execution, we must split the ID pipe stage into two stages:

> 在较早开发的 RISC V 管道中，在说明解码(ID)期间检查了结构性和数据危害：如果可以正确执行指令，则从 ID 中发出。为了允许指令在其操作后立即开始执行，即使前任停滞不前，我们也必须将问题过程分为两个部分：检查结构性危害并等待缺乏数据危害。我们按顺序解码并发布说明；但是，我们希望指令在可用的数据操作数后立即开始执行。因此，管道将执行_out-Out corderecution_，这意味着_out-Out of-Out of-Out contemion_。要实现序列执行，我们必须将 ID 管道阶段分为两个阶段：

1. _Issue_—Decode instructions, check for structural hazards.

> 1. _issue_-指定说明，检查结构性危害。

2. _Read operands_—Wait until no data hazards, then read operands.

> 2. _read 操作数 - 等待直到没有数据危害为止，然后阅读操作数。

The IF stage proceeds the issue stage, and the EX stage follows the read oper- ands stage, just as in the RISC V pipeline. As in the RISC V floating-point pipeline, execution may take multiple cycles, depending on the operation. Thus, we may need to distinguish when an instruction _begins execution_ and when it _completes execution_; between the two times, the instruction is _in execution_. This allows mul- tiple instructions to be in execution at the same time. In addition to these changes to the pipeline structure, we will also change the functional unit design by varying the number of units, the latency of operations, and the functional unit pipelining so as to better explore these more advanced pipelining techniques.

> IF 阶段进行了问题阶段，前阶段遵循读取操作阶段，就像在 RISC V Pipeline 中一样。就像在 RISC V 浮点管道中一样，执行可能会根据操作而进行多个周期。因此，我们可能需要区分指令_begins execution_及其_completes execution_;在两次之间，指令为_in execution_。这允许使用指令同时执行。除了对管道结构的这些更改之外，我们还将通过改变单元数量，操作延迟和功能单元管道来更改功能单元设计，从而更好地探索这些更先进的管道技术。

##### _Dynamic Scheduling With a Scoreboard_

> ##### _ dynamic 调度带有记分牌_

In a dynamically scheduled pipeline, all instructions pass through the issue stage in order (in-order issue); however, they can be stalled or bypass each other in the sec- ond stage (read operands) and thus enter execution out of order. _Scoreboarding_ is a technique for allowing instructions to execute out of order when there are sufficient resources and no data dependences; it is named after the CDC 6600 scoreboard, which developed this capability.

> 在动态安排的管道中，所有指令都以秩序(按顺序发行)通过了问题阶段；但是，它们可以在第二阶段(读取操作数)中停滞或绕过对方，从而输入执行。_scoreboarding_是一种技术，可以在有足够的资源且没有数据依赖的情况下允许指令执行订单；它以 CDC 6600 计分板的名字命名，该记分牌开发了此功能。

Before we see how scoreboarding could be used in the RISC V pipeline, it is important to observe that WAR hazards, which did not exist in the RISC V floating-point or integer pipelines, may arise when instructions execute out of order. For example, consider the following code sequence:

> 在我们看到 RISC V 管道中如何使用计分板之前，重要的是要观察到，在指令执行订单时，可能会出现 RISC V 浮点或整数管道中不存在的战争危害。例如，考虑以下代码序列：

There is an potential WAR hazard between the fadd.d and the fsub.d: If the pipeline executes the fsub.d before the fadd.d, it will violate yield incor- rect execution. Likewise, the pipeline must avoid WAW hazards (e.g.,as would occur if the destination of the fsub.d were f10). As we will see, both these haz- ards are avoided in a scoreboard by stalling the later instruction involved in the hazard.

> FADD.D 和 FSUB.D 之间存在潜在的战争危害：如果管道在 FADD.D 之前执行 FSUB.D，它将违反收益率的执行。同样，管道必须避免使用 WAW 危害(例如，如果 FSUB.D 的目的地为 F10)。正如我们将看到的那样，这两种危险都可以在记分牌中避免使用危险中涉及的后来指示。

The goal of a scoreboard is to maintain an execution rate of one instruction per clock cycle (when there are no structural hazards) by executing an instruction as early as possible. Thus, when the next instruction to execute is stalled, other instructions can be issued and executed if they do not depend on any active or stalled instruction. The scoreboard takes full responsibility for instruction issue and execution, including all hazard detection. Taking advantage of out-of-order execution requires multiple instructions to be in their EX stage simultaneously. This can be achieved with multiple functional units, with pipelined functional units, or with both. Because these two capabilities—pipelined functional units and multiple functional units—are essentially equivalent for the purposes of pipe- line control, we will assume the processor has multiple functional units.

> 记分牌的目的是通过尽早执行指令来维持每个时钟周期的执行率(如果没有结构性危害)。因此，当下一个执行执行的指令停滞不前时，如果不依赖任何活动或停滞的指令，则可以发出和执行其他说明。计分板对指令问题和执行负有全部责任，包括所有危险检测。利用排序执行的优势需要多个指令同时进入其前阶段。这可以通过多个功能单元，管道功能单元或两者都能实现。因为这两个功能(涉及双重功能单元和多个功能单元)本质上是相当于管道控制的目的，所以我们将假设处理器具有多个功能单元。

The CDC 6600 had 16 separate functional units, including 4 floating-point units, 5 units for memory references, and 7 units for integer operations. On a processor for the RISC V architecture, scoreboards make sense primarily on the floating-point unit because the latency of the other functional units is very small. Let’s assume that there are two multipliers, one adder, one divide unit, and a single integer unit for all mem- ory references, branches, and integer operations. Although this example is simpler than the CDC 6600, it is sufficiently powerful to demonstrate the principles without having a mass of detail or needing very long examples. Because both RISC V and the CDC 6600 are load-store architectures, the techniques are nearly identical for the two processors. [Figure C.49](#_bookmark536) shows what the processor looks like.

> CDC 6600 具有 16 个单独的功能单元，包括 4 个浮点单元，5 个用于内存参考的单元和 7 个用于整数操作的单元。在 RISC V 架构的处理器上，记分板主要在浮点单元上有意义，因为其他功能单元的延迟非常小。让我们假设有两个乘数，一个加法器，一个分隔单元和一个用于所有 mem-ory 参考，分支机构和整数操作的单个整数单元。尽管此示例比 CDC 6600 更简单，但它足够强大，可以在没有大量细节或需要很长的示例的情况下演示原理。因为 RISC V 和 CDC 6600 都是负载商店架构，因此对于两个处理器而言，这些技术几乎相同。[图 C.49](#_ bookmark536)显示了处理器的外观。

Every instruction goes through the scoreboard, where a record of the data dependences is constructed; this step corresponds to instruction issue and replaces part of the ID step in the RISC V pipeline. The scoreboard then determines when the instruction can read its operands and begin execution. If the scoreboard decides the instruction cannot execute immediately, it monitors every change in the hard- ware and decides when the instruction _can_ execute. The scoreboard also controls when an instruction can write its result into the destination register. Thus, all hazard detection and resolution are centralized in the scoreboard. We will see a picture of the scoreboard later ([Figure C.49](#_bookmark536) on page C.68), but first we need to understand the steps in the issue and execution segment of the pipeline.

> 每个指令都通过计分板，其中构建了数据依赖的记录；此步骤对应于指令问题，并替换了 RISC V 管道中的 ID 步骤的一部分。然后，计分板确定指令何时可以读取其操作数并开始执行。如果计分板决定指令无法立即执行，则它会监视硬件中的每一个更改，并决定何时执行指令。计分板还控制指令何时可以将其结果写入目标寄存器。因此，所有危害检测和分辨率都集中在计分板上。我们将在稍后看到计分板的图片([图 C.49](#_ bookmark536)，第 68 页)，但首先我们需要了解管道问题和执行段的步骤。

Each instruction undergoes four steps in executing. (Because we are concen- trating on the FP operations, we will not consider a step for memory access.) Let’s first examine the steps informally and then look in detail at how the scoreboard keeps the necessary information that determines when to progress from one step to the next. The four steps, which replace the ID, EX, and WB steps in the standard RISC V pipeline, are as follows:

> 每个指令在执行时都会执行四个步骤。(因为我们对 FP 操作进行了调整，所以我们不会考虑用于内存访问的步骤。)让我们首先对步骤进行非正式检查步骤，然后详细介绍计分板如何保留确定何时从一个步骤进行进展的必要信息到下一个。替换标准 RISC V 管道中 ID，EX 和 WB 步骤的四个步骤如下：

1. _Issue_—If a functional unit for the instruction is free and no other active instruc- tion has the same destination register, the scoreboard issues the instruction to the functional unit and updates its internal data structure. This step replaces a portion of the ID step in the RISC V pipeline. By ensuring that no other active functional unit wants to write its result into the destination register, we guaran- tee that WAW hazards cannot be present. If a structural or WAW hazard exists, then the instruction issue stalls, and no further instructions will issue until these hazards are cleared. When the issue stage stalls, it causes the buffer between instruction fetch and issue to fill; if the buffer is a single entry, instruction fetch stalls immediately. If the buffer is a queue with multiple instructions, it stalls when the queue fills.

> 1. _issue _-如果指令的功能单元是免费的，并且没有其他主动仪器具有相同的目的地寄存器，则计分板向功能单元发出指令并更新其内部数据结构。此步骤替换了 RISC V 管道中 ID 步骤的一部分。通过确保没有其他活跃的功能单元希望将其结果写入目标寄存器，我们可以将 WAW 危害不存在。如果存在结构性或扭曲危险，则指令发出摊位，并且在清除这些危害之前，不会发出进一步的指示。当问题阶段失速时，它会导致指令提取和发行之间的缓冲区；如果缓冲区是单个条目，则指令立即获取失速。如果缓冲区是带有多个说明的队列，则队列填充时会停滞不前。

Figure C.49 The basic structure of a RISC V processor with a scoreboard. The score- board’s function is to control instruction execution (vertical control lines). All of the data flow between the register file and the functional units over the buses (the horizontal lines, called _trunks_ in the CDC 6600). There are two FP multipliers, an FP divider, an FP adder, and an integer unit. One set of buses (two inputs and one output) serves a group of functional units. We will explore scoreboarding and its extensions in more detail in [Chapter 3](#_bookmark93).

> 图 C.49 带有记分牌的 RISC V 处理器的基本结构。得分板的功能是控制指令执行(垂直控制线)。寄存器文件和总线上的功能单元之间的所有数据流(在 CDC 6600 中称为_trunks_的水平线)。有两个 FP 乘数，一个 FP 分隔器，一个 FP 加法器和一个整数单元。一组总线(两个输入和一组输出)为一组功能单元提供服务。我们将在[第 3 章](#_ bookmark93)中更详细地探索记分板及其扩展。

1. _Read operands_—The scoreboard monitors the availability of the source oper- ands. A source operand is available if no earlier issued active instruction is going to write it. When the source operands are available, the scoreboard tells the functional unit to proceed to read the operands from the registers and begin execution. The scoreboard resolves RAW hazards dynamically in this step, and instructions may be sent into execution out of order. This step, together with issue, completes the function of the ID step in the simple RISC V pipeline.

> 1. _read 操作数 - 计分板监视源操作和源操作的可用性。如果没有较早发行的主动指令将编写它，则可以使用源操作数。当源操作数可用时，记分板告诉功能单元继续从寄存器中读取操作数并开始执行。计分板在此步骤中动态解决原始危害，并将指令发送到执行中。此步骤与问题一起完成了简单的 RISC V 管道中 ID 步骤的功能。

2. _Execution_—The functional unit begins execution upon receiving operands. When the result is ready, it notifies the scoreboard that it has completed execu- tion. This step replaces the EX step in the RISC V pipeline and takes multiple cycles in the RISC V FP pipeline.

> 2. _execution_  - 接收操作数后，功能单元开始执行。结果准备就绪后，它会通知记分板已完成执行。此步骤替换了 RISC V 管道中的 EX 步骤，并在 RISC V FP 管道中采用多个周期。

3. _Write result_—Once the scoreboard is aware that the functional unit has completed execution, the scoreboard checks for WAR hazards and stalls the completing instruction, if necessary.

> 3. _write 结果_-一旦计分板意识到功能单元已完成执行，计分板检查战争危害，并在必要时停止完成指令。

which is the same register as the destination of fsub.d. But fadd.d actually depends on an earlier instruction. The scoreboard will still stall the fsub.d in its write result stage until fadd.d reads its operands. In general, then, a completing instruction cannot be allowed to write its results when:

> 与 FSUB.D 的目的地相同的寄存器。但是 Fadd.d 实际上取决于早期的指示。记分牌仍将在 FSUB.D 的写入阶段停滞不前，直到 Fadd.D 读取其操作数。一般而言，当以下内容：

- There is an instruction that has not read its operands that precedes (i.e., in order of issue) the completing instruction, and

> - 有一项指令尚未阅读其在完成指令(即，在问题上)之前的操作数(即，

- One of the operands is the same register as the result of the completing instruction.

> - 操作数之一是与完成指令的结果相同的寄存器。

If this WAR hazard does not exist, or when it clears, the scoreboard tells the func- tional unit to store its result to the destination register. This step replaces the WB step in the simple RISC V pipeline.

> 如果不存在这场战争危害，或者当清除时，记分板告诉弹性单位将其结果存储到目标寄存器中。此步骤替换了简单的 RISC V 管道中的 WB 步骤。

At first glance, it might appear that the scoreboard will have difficulty separat- ing RAW and WAR hazards.

> 乍一看，计分板似乎很难分离原始和战争危险。

Because the operands for an instruction are read only when both operands are available in the register file, this scoreboard does not take advantage of forwarding. Instead, registers are only read when they are both available. This is not as large a penalty as you might initially think. Unlike our simple pipeline of earlier, instruc- tions will write their result into the register file as soon as they complete execution (assuming no WAR hazards), rather than wait for a statically assigned write slot that may be several cycles away. The effect reduces the pipeline latency and the benefits of forwarding. There is still one additional cycle of latency that arises because the write result and read operand stages cannot overlap. We would need additional buffering to eliminate this overhead.

> 由于仅在寄存器文件中都有两个操作数时才读取指令的操作数，因此该计分板不利用转发。相反，只有在两个可用时才读取寄存器。这并不像您最初想象的那样大。与我们早期的简单管道不同，一旦执行执行(假设没有战争危害)，教学将将其结果写入寄存器文件，而不是等待静态分配的写入插槽可能是几个周期。效果减少了管道延迟和转发的好处。由于写入结果和读取操作数阶段无法重叠，因此仍有一个额外的延迟周期。我们需要额外的缓冲来消除此开销。

Based on its own data structure, the scoreboard controls the instruction pro- gression from one step to the next by communicating with the functional units. There is a small complication, however. There are only a limited number of source operand buses and result buses to the register file, which represents a structural hazard. The scoreboard must guarantee that the number of func- tional units allowed to proceed into steps 2 and 4 does not exceed the number of buses available. We will not go into further detail on this, other than to men- tion that the CDC 6600 solved this problem by grouping the 16 functional units together into four groups and supplying a set of buses, called _data trunks_, for each group. Only one unit in a group could read its operands or write its result during a clock.

> 根据其自己的数据结构，计分板通过与功能单元进行通信，将指令从一个步骤转到另一个步骤。但是，有一个很小的并发症。寄存器文件只有数量有限的源操作数和结果总线，这代表了结构性危害。记分牌必须确保允许进入步骤 2 和 4 的拟合设备的数量不会超过可用的公共汽车数量。除了确定 CDC 6600 通过将 16 个功能单元分组在一起四个组并为每个组提供一组称为_DATA TRUNKS_的总线，我们将不会进一步详细介绍此问题。一组中只有一个单元可以读取其操作数或在时钟期间写入结果。

Pitfall _Unexpected execution sequences may cause unexpected hazards_.

> 陷阱_提出的执行序列可能会导致意外危害_。

At first glance, WAW hazards look like they should never occur in a code sequence because no compiler would ever generate two writes to the same register without an intervening read, but they can occur when the sequence is unexpected. For exam- ple, consider a long running floating point divide that causes a trap. If the trap rou- tine writes the same register as the divide early on, it may cause a WAW hazard, if it writes the register before the divide completes. Hardware or software must avoid this possibility.

> 乍一看，WAW 危害看起来永远不应该以代码顺序出现，因为没有编译器不会在没有中间阅读的情况下生成两个写入同一寄存器的写入，但是当序列是出乎意料的情况下，它们可能会发生。对于检查，请考虑导致陷阱的长期运行浮点划分。如果陷阱胭脂的写入与鸿沟早期相同的登记册，则如果在鸿沟完成之前写下登记册，则可能会引起误差危险。硬件或软件必须避免这种可能性。

Pitfall _Extensive pipelining can impact other aspects of a design, leading to overall worse cost-performance_.

> 陷阱_扩展的管道可能会影响设计的其他方面，从而导致总体成本较差。

The best example of this phenomenon comes from two implementations of the VAX, the 8600 and the 8700. When the 8600 was initially delivered, it had a cycle time of 80 ns. Subsequently, a redesigned version, called the 8650, with a 55 ns clock was introduced. The 8700 has a much simpler pipeline that operates at the microinstruction level, yielding a smaller processor with a faster clock cycle of 45 ns. The overall outcome is that the 8650 has a CPI advantage of about 20%, but the 8700 has a clock rate that is about 20% faster. Thus, the 8700 achieved the same performance with much less hardware.

> 这种现象的最好例子来自 VAX 的两个实现，即 8600 和 8700。当最初交付 8600 时，它的周期时间为 80 ns。随后，引入了一个名为 8650 的重新设计版本，并引入了 55 NS 时钟。8700 具有更简单的管道，该管道在微观建筑级别运行，产生了一个较小的处理器，其时钟周期更快为 45 ns。总体结果是 8650 的 CPI 优势约为 20％，但 8700 的时钟速率快约 20％。因此，8700 的硬件少得多。

Pitfall _Evaluating dynamic or static scheduling on the basis of unoptimized code_.

> 陷阱_评估动态或静态调度基于未优化的代码_。

Unoptimized code—containing redundant loads, stores, and other operations that might be eliminated by an optimizer—is much easier to schedule than “tight” optimized code. This holds for scheduling both control delays (with delayed branches) and delays arising from RAW hazards. In gcc running on an R3000, which has a pipeline almost identical to that of [Section C.1](#introduction-8), the fre- quency of idle clock cycles increases by 18% from the unoptimized and sched- uled code to the optimized and scheduled code. Of course, the optimized program is much faster, because it has fewer instructions. To fairly evaluate a compile-time scheduler or runtime dynamic scheduling, you must use optimized code, because in the real system you will derive good performance from other optimizations in addition to scheduling.

> 与“紧密”优化代码相比，不优化的代码(包括优化器可能会被优化器消除的冗余负载，商店和其他操作)更容易安排。这有助于安排控制延迟(带有延迟的分支)和由原始危害引起的延迟。在 R3000 上运行的 GCC 中，该管道的管道几乎与[C.1](＃resoped-8)相同，闲置时钟周期的频率从未优化和计划的代码中增加了 18％优化和计划的代码。当然，优化程序要快得多，因为它的说明较少。要公平地评估编译时间调度程序或运行时动态调度，您必须使用优化的代码，因为在实际系统中，除了调度外，您还将从其他优化中获得良好的性能。
