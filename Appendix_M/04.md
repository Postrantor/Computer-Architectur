## The Development of Memory Hierarchy and Protection ([Chapter 2](#_bookmark46) and [Appendix B](#_bookmark436))

> ##内存层次结构和保护的开发([[第 2 章](#_ bookmark46)和[附录 B](#_ bookmark436))

Although the pioneers of computing knew of the need for a memory hierarchy and coined the term, the automatic management of two levels was first proposed by Kilburn et al. [1962]. It was demonstrated with the Atlas computer at the University of Manchester. This computer appeared the year before the IBM 360 was announced. Although IBM planned for its introduction with the next genera- tion (System/370), the operating system TSS was not up to the challenge in 1970. Virtual memory was announced for the 370 family in 1972, and it was for this com- puter that the term _translation lookaside buffer_ was coined [Case and Padegs 1978]. The only computers today without virtual memory are a few supercom- puters, embedded processors, and older personal computers.

> 尽管计算的开拓者知道需要记忆层次结构并创造了该术语，但 Kilburn 等人首先提出了两个级别的自动管理。[1962]。它已与曼彻斯特大学的 Atlas 计算机进行了证明。这台计算机出现在宣布 IBM 360 的前一年。尽管 IBM 计划介绍下一个世代(System/370)，但操作系统 TSS 在 1970 年不符合挑战。1972 年为 370 家族宣布了虚拟记忆，这是针对此公司的。_ translation lookAside buffer_一词是创造的[CASE 和 PADEGS 1978]。当今没有虚拟内存的唯一计算机是一些超级计算机，嵌入式处理器和较旧的个人计算机。

Both the Atlas and the IBM 360 provided protection on pages, and the GE 645 was the first system to provide paged segmentation. The earlier Burroughs computers provided virtual memory using segmentation, similar to the seg- mented address scheme of the Intel 8086. The 80286, the first 80x86 to have the protection mechanisms described in [Appendix C](#_bookmark481), was inspired by the Multics protection software that ran on the GE 645. Over time, computers evolved more elaborate mechanisms. The most elaborate mechanism was _capa- bilities_, which attracted the greatest interest in the late 1970s and early 1980s [Fabry 1974; Wulf, Levin, and Harbison 1981]. Wilkes [1982], one of the early workers on capabilities, had this to say:

> Atlas 和 IBM 360 都提供了页面保护，而 GE 645 是第一个提供分页分段的系统。较早的 Burroughs 计算机使用分割提供了虚拟内存，类似于 Intel 8086 的序列地址方案。80286，第一个 80x86 具有[附录 C]中描述的保护机制(#_bookmark481)，受到了 Multics 的启发。在 GE645 上运行的保护软件。随着时间的流逝，计算机进化了更精致的机制。最精致的机制是_CAPA-FILICY_，它在 1970 年代末和 1980 年代初引起了最大的兴趣[Fabry 1974;Wulf，Levin 和 Harbison 1981]。威尔克斯(Wilkes)[1982]是能力的早期工人之一，他说：

_Anyone who has been concerned with an implementation of the type just described [capability system], or has tried to explain one to others, is likely to feel that complexity has got out of hand. It is particularly disappointing that the attractive idea of capabilities being tickets that can be freely handed around has become lost_ …_._

> _一直关心刚刚描述的类型[能力系统]或试图向他人解释的类型的任何人都可能感到复杂性已经失控了。特别令人失望的是，可以自由交出的能力的吸引力的想法已经丢失了_…_._

_Compared with a conventional computer system, there will inevitably be a cost to be met in providing a system in which the domains of protection are small and frequently changed. This cost will manifest itself in terms of additional hardware, decreased runtime speed, and increased memory occupancy. It is at present an open question whether, by adoption of the capability approach, the cost can be reduced to reasonable proportions. [p. 112]_

> _与传统的计算机系统相关联，在提供一个保护域很小且经常更改的系统时，不可避免地要承担成本。这种成本将以额外的硬件，降低运行时速度和增加的内存占用率来表现出来。目前，是否可以通过采用能力方法，将成本降低为合理的比例，这是一个公开的问题。[p。112] _

Today there is little interest in capabilities either from the operating systems or the computer architecture communities, despite growing interest in protection and security.

> 如今，尽管对保护和安全性越来越兴趣，但对操作系统或计算机架构社区的能力却几乎没有兴趣。

Bell and Strecker [1976] reflected on the PDP-11 and identified a small address space as the only architectural mistake that is difficult to recover from. At the time of the creation of PDP-11, core memories were increasing at a very slow rate. In addition, competition from 100 other minicomputer companies meant that DEC might not have a cost-competitive product if every address had to go through the 16-bit data path twice, hence the architect’s decision to add only 4 more address bits than found in the predecessor of the PDP-11.

> Bell and Strecker [1976]对 PDP-11 进行了反思，并确定了一个小的地址空间是难以从中恢复的唯一建筑错误。在创建 PDP-11 时，核心记忆以非常缓慢的速度增加。此外，来自其他 100 家微型计算机公司的竞争意味着，如果每个地址都必须经过 16 位数据路径，则 DEC 可能没有成本竞争力的产品，因此工程师决定仅添加 4 个地址比在此处的地址要多 4 个。PDP-11 的前身。

The architects of the IBM 360 were aware of the importance of address size and planned for the architecture to extend to 32 bits of address. Only 24 bits were used in the IBM 360, however, because the low-end 360 models would have been even slower with the larger addresses in 1964. Unfortunately, the architects didn’t reveal their plans to the software people, and programmers who stored extra information in the upper 8 “unused” address bits foiled the expansion effort. (Apple made a similar mistake 20 years later with the 24-bit address in the Motorola 68000, which required a procedure to later determine “32-bit clean” programs for the Macintosh when later 68000s used the full 32-bit virtual address.) Virtually every computer since then will check to make sure the unused bits stay unused and trap if the bits have the wrong value.

> IBM 360 的工程师意识到地址大小的重要性，并计划将架构扩展到 32 位地址。但是，IBM 360 中仅使用了 24 位，因为在 1964 年，低端 360 型号的较大地址会更慢。不幸的是，工程师没有向软件人员透露他们的计划，而存储的程序员也没有透露他们的计划。上部 8 个“未使用”地址中的额外信息挫败了扩展工作。(20 年后，苹果在摩托罗拉 68000 中的 24 位地址犯了一个类似的错误，该程序需要一项程序，以便以后确定 Macintosh 的“ 32 位清洁”程序，而 68000 后来使用了完整的 32 位虚拟地址。从那时起，几乎每台计算机都会检查，以确保未使用的位保持未使用并捕获，如果位具有错误的值。

As mentioned in the text, system virtual machines were pioneered at IBM as part of its investigation into virtual memory. IBM’s first computer with virtual memory was the IBM 360/67, introduced in 1967. IBM researchers wrote the program CP-67 that created the illusion of several independent 360 computers. They then wrote an interactive, single-user operating system called CMS that ran on these virtual machines. CP-67 led to the product VM/370, and today IBM sells z/VM for its mainframe computers [Meyer and Seawright 1970; Van Vleck 2005].

> 如文本中所述，系统虚拟机是对虚拟内存的调查的一部分。IBM 的第一台具有虚拟内存的计算机是 1967 年推出的 IBM 360/67。IBM 研究人员编写了 CP-67 程序，该程序构成了几台独立 360 计算机的幻觉。然后，他们编写了一个称为 CMS 的交互式单用户操作系统，该操作系统在这些虚拟机上运行。CP-67 导致了产品 VM/370，今天 IBM 出售了其大型计算机的 Z/VM [Meyer and Seawright 1970;Van Vleck 2005]。

A few years after the Atlas paper, Wilkes published the first paper describing the concept of a cache [1965]:

> 在《地图集》论文几年后，威尔克斯发表了第一篇描述缓存概念的论文[1965]：

_The use is discussed of a fast core memory of, say, 32,000 words as slave to a slower core memory of, say, one million words in such a way that in practical cases the effective access time is nearer that of the fast memory than that of the slow memory. [p. 270]_

> _使用 32,000 个单词的快速核心内存讨论了用作较慢的核心记忆，例如，在实际情况下，有效的访问时间比快速记忆更接近，而不是那样。记忆缓慢。[p。270] _

This two-page paper describes a direct-mapped cache. Although this is the first publication on caches, the first implementation was probably a direct-mapped instruction cache built at the University of Cambridge. It was based on tunnel diode memory, the fastest form of memory available at the time. Wilkes stated that G. Scarott suggested the idea of a cache memory.

> 这本两页的论文描述了一个直接映射的缓存。尽管这是关于缓存的第一本出版物，但第一个实施可能是剑桥大学建造的直接映射指令缓存。它基于隧道二极管内存，这是当时可用的最快内存形式。威尔克斯说，G。Scarott 提出了缓存内存的想法。

Subsequent to that publication, IBM started a project that led to the first com- mercial computer with a cache, the IBM 360/85 [Liptay 1968]. Gibson [1967] described how to measure program behavior as memory traffic as well as miss rate and showed how the miss rate varies between programs. Using a sample of 20 pro- grams (each with 3 million references!), Gibson also relied on average memory access time to compare systems with and without caches. This precedent is more than 40 years old, and yet many used miss rates until the early 1990s.

> 在该出版物之后，IBM 启动了一个项目，该项目导致了第一台带有缓存的商业计算机，即 IBM 360/85 [Liptay 1968]。Gibson [1967]描述了如何将程序行为衡量作为记忆流量以及错过率，并展示了程序之间的错率如何变化。吉布森(Gibson)使用 20 个程序的样本(每个都有 300 万参考！)，还依靠记忆访问时间来比较带有和没有缓存的系统。这一先例已有 40 多年的历史了，但是直到 1990 年代初，许多先例使用了失误。

Conti, Gibson, and Pitkowsky [1968] described the resulting performance of the 360/85. The 360/91 outperforms the 360/85 on only 3 of the 11 programs in the paper, even though the 360/85 has a slower clock cycle time (80 ns versus 60 ns), less memory interleaving (4 versus 16), and a slower main memory (1.04 microsecond versus 0.75 microsecond). This paper was also the first to use the term _cache_.

> Conti，Gibson 和 Pitkowsky [1968]描述了 360/85 的结果表现。360/91 在本文中 11 个程序中只有 3 个 360/85 的表现，即使 360/85 的时钟周期时间较慢(80 ns 对 60 ns)，较少的内存相互交织(4 对 16)和主内存较慢(1.04 微秒与 0.75 微秒)。本文也是第一个使用术语_cache_的论文。

Others soon expanded the cache literature. Strecker [1976] published the first comparative cache design paper examining caches for the PDP-11. Smith [1982] later published a thorough survey paper that used the terms _spatial locality_ and _temporal locality_; this paper has served as a reference for many computer designers.

> 其他人很快扩大了缓存文献。Strecker [1976]发表了第一张比较缓存设计论文，研究了 PDP-11 的缓存。Smith [1982]后来发表了一份详尽的调查文件，该论文使用术语_ -Spatial locality_和_temporal locality_;本文已成为许多计算机设计人员的参考。

Although most studies relied on simulations, Clark [1983] used a hardware monitor to record cache misses of the VAX-11/780 over several days. Clark and Emer [1985] later compared simulations and hardware measurements for translations.

> 尽管大多数研究都依赖于模拟，但 Clark [1983]使用硬件监视器在几天内记录 VAX-11/780 的缓存错过。Clark and Emer [1985]后来比较了翻译的模拟和硬件测量。

Hill [1987] proposed the three C’s used in [Appendix B](#_bookmark436) to explain cache misses. Jouppi [1998] retrospectively said that Hill’s three C’s model led directly to his invention of the victim cache to take advantage of faster direct-mapped caches and yet avoid most of the cost of conflict misses. Sugumar and Abraham [1993] argued that the baseline cache for the three C’s model should use optimal replacement; this would eliminate the anomalies of least recently used (LRU)-based miss classification and allow conflict misses to be broken down into those caused by mapping and those caused by a nonoptimal replacement algorithm.

> Hill [1987]提出了[附录 B](#_ bookmark436)中使用的三个 C 来解释缓存失误。Jouppi [1998]回顾性地说，希尔的三个 C 模型直接导致了他对受害者缓存的发明，以利用更快的直接映射缓存，但避免了大部分冲突费用。Sugumar 和 Abraham [1993]认为，三个 C 模型的基线缓存应使用最佳替代品。这将消除最不最近使用的异常(LRU)的错过分类，并允许冲突错过被映射和由非优化替代算法引起的映射引起的。

One of the first papers on nonblocking caches was by Kroft [1981]. Kroft [1998] later explained that he was the first to design a computer with a cache at

> 关于非封锁缓存的第一批论文之一是克罗夫特[1981]。克罗夫特[1998]后来解释说，他是第一个设计带有缓存的计算机的人

Control Data Corporation, and when using old concepts for new mechanisms he hit upon the idea of allowing his two-ported cache to continue to service other accesses on a miss.

> 控制数据公司，当使用旧概念用于新机制时，他想到了允许他的两端口缓存继续为失误服务的其他访问服务的想法。

Baer and Wang [1988] did one of the first examinations of the multilevel inclu- sion property. Wang, Baer, and Levy [1989] then produced an early paper on per- formance evaluation of multilevel caches. Later, Jouppi and Wilton [1994] proposed multilevel exclusion for multilevel caches on chip.

> Baer and Wang [1988]进行了多级包容性能的首次检查之一。Wang，Baer 和 Levy [1989]随后发表了一份关于多级缓存评估的早期论文。后来，Jouppi 和 Wilton [1994]提出了芯片多级缓存的多级排除。

In addition to victim caches, Jouppi [1990] also examined prefetching via streaming buffers. His work was extended by Farkas, Jouppi, and Chow [1995] to streaming buffers that work well with nonblocking loads and speculative exe- cution for in-order processors, and later Farkas et al. [1997] showed that, while out- of-order processors can tolerate unpredictable latency better, they still benefit. They also refined memory bandwidth demands of stream buffers.

> 除了受害者缓存外，Jouppi [1990]还通过流媒体缓冲液进行了预摘要。Farkas，Jouppi 和 Chow [1995]将他的工作扩展到流媒体缓冲液，这些缓冲区与非封锁负载和对固定处理器的投机性相同，后来是 Farkas 等人。[1997]表明，虽然订购的处理器可以更好地忍受不可预测的潜伏期，但它们仍然受益。他们还完善了流缓冲区的内存带宽需求。

Proceedings of the Symposium on Architectural Support for Compilers and Operating Systems (ASPLOS) and the International Computer Architecture Sym- posium (ISCA) from the 1990s are filled with papers on caches. (In fact, some wags claimed ISCA really stood for the International _Cache_ Architecture Symposium.)
