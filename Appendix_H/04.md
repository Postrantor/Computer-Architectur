## Hardware Support for Compiler Speculation

As we saw in [Chapter 3](#_bookmark93), many programs have branches that can be accurately pre- dicted at compile time either from the program structure or by using a profile. In such cases, the compiler may want to speculate either to improve the scheduling or to increase the issue rate. Predicated instructions provide one method to speculate, but they are really more useful when control dependences can be completely elim- inated by if conversion. In many cases, we would like to move speculated instruc- tions not only before the branch but also before the condition evaluation, and predication cannot achieve this.

> 正如我们在[第 3 章](#_bookmark93)中看到的那样，许多程序都有可以在程序结构或使用配置文件中准确预定的分支。在这种情况下，编译器可能希望推测提高计划率或提高发行率。预测指令提供了一种推测方法，但是当可以通过 IF 转换完全消除控制依赖时，它们确实更有用。在许多情况下，我们不仅要在分支机构之前，而且在条件评估之前进行推测的指导，而且谓词无法实现这一目标。

To speculate ambitiously requires three capabilities:

> 为了推测有雄心勃勃的需要三个功能：

1. The ability of the compiler to find instructions that, with the possible use of reg- ister renaming, can be speculatively moved and not affect the program data flow

> 1.编译器能够找到指令的能力，这些说明可能会使用重命名的重命名，可以进行推测，并且不会影响程序数据流

2. The ability to ignore exceptions in speculated instructions, until we know that such exceptions should really occur

> 2.在推测说明中忽略异常的能力，直到我们知道这种例外应该发生

3. The ability to speculatively interchange loads and stores, or stores and stores, which may have address conflicts

> 3.投机互换负载和存储或商店和商店的能力，可能有解决冲突

The first of these is a compiler capability, while the last two require hardware sup- port, which we explore next.

> 第一个是编译器功能，而最后两个需要硬件支持，我们接下来要探索。

### Hardware Support for Preserving Exception Behavior

To speculate ambitiously, we must be able to move any type of instruction and still preserve its exception behavior. The key to being able to do this is to observe that the results of a speculated sequence that is mispredicted will not be used in the final computation, and such a speculated instruction should not cause an exception.

> 为了雄心勃勃，我们必须能够移动任何类型的指令并仍然保留其异常行为。能够做到这一点的关键是要观察到最终计算中不使用错误预测的序列的结果，并且这种推测的指令不应导致例外。

There are four methods that have been investigated for supporting more ambi- tious speculation without introducing erroneous exception behavior:

> 已经研究了四种方法，用于支持更多的狂热猜测，而没有引入错误的例外行为：

1. The hardware and operating system cooperatively ignore exceptions for spec- ulative instructions. As we will see later, this approach preserves exception behavior for correct programs, but not for incorrect ones. This approach may be viewed as unacceptable for some programs, but it has been used, under pro- gram control, as a "fast mode" in several processors.

> 1.硬件和操作系统合作忽略了针对特定说明的例外。正如我们稍后将看到的那样，这种方法保留了正确程序的异常行为，但不能保留错误的程序。对于某些程序，可以将这种方法视为不可接受，但是在范围控制下，它已被用作几个处理器中的 "快速模式" 。

2. Speculative instructions that never raise exceptions are used, and checks are introduced to determine when an exception should occur.

> 2.使用永不提高例外的投机说明，并引入检查以确定何时应发生异常。

3. A set of status bits, called _poison bits_, are attached to the result registers written by speculated instructions when the instructions cause exceptions. The poison bits cause a fault when a normal instruction attempts to use the register.

> 3.当指令导致例外时，将一组称为 *poison bits* 的状态位连接到由推测指令编写的结果寄存器。当正常的指令试图使用寄存器时，毒物位会导致故障。

4. A mechanism is provided to indicate that an instruction is speculative, and the hardware buffers the instruction result until it is certain that the instruction is no longer speculative.

> 4.提供了一种机制来表明指令是投机性的，并且硬件缓冲指令结果，直到确定指令不再是投机性的。

To explain these schemes, we need to distinguish between exceptions that indi- cate a program error and would normally cause termination, such as a memory pro- tection violation, and those that are handled and normally resumed, such as a page fault. Exceptions that can be resumed can be accepted and processed for specula- tive instructions just as if they were normal instructions. If the speculative instruc- tion should not have been executed, handling the unneeded exception may have some negative performance effects, but it cannot cause incorrect execution. The cost of these exceptions may be high, however, and some processors use hardware support to avoid taking such exceptions, just as processors with hardware specu- lation may take some exceptions in speculative mode, while avoiding others until an instruction is known not to be speculative.

> 为了解释这些方案，我们需要区分指示程序错误并且通常会导致终止的异常，例如内存保护违规，以及那些被处理并正常恢复的异常，例如页面错误。对于推测指令，可以接受和处理可以恢复的异常，就好像它们是正常指令一样。如果推测指令不应该被执行，处理不需要的异常可能会对性能产生一些负面影响，但它不会导致不正确的执行。然而，这些异常的成本可能很高，并且一些处理器使用硬件支持来避免出现此类异常，就像具有硬件推测的处理器可能会在推测模式下出现一些异常，同时避免其他异常，直到知道一条指令不被接受。投机的。

Exceptions that indicate a program error should not occur in correct programs, and the result of a program that gets such an exception is not well defined, except perhaps when the program is running in a debugging mode. If such exceptions arise in speculated instructions, we cannot take the exception until we know that the instruction is no longer speculative.

> 表明程序错误不应在正确的程序中不应发生的例外，并且程序的结果不能很好地定义，除非程序在调试模式下运行。如果在推测说明中出现了这种例外，则在我们知道指令不再投机之前，我们不能采取异常。

In the simplest method for preserving exceptions, the hardware and the oper- ating system simply handle all resumable exceptions when the exception occurs and simply return an undefined value for any exception that would cause termina- tion. If the instruction generating the terminating exception was not speculative, then the program is in error. Note that instead of terminating the program, the program is allowed to continue, although it will almost certainly generate incorrect results. If the instruction generating the terminating exception is speculative, then the program may be correct and the speculative result will simply be unused; thus, returning an undefined value for the instruction cannot be harmful. This scheme can never cause a correct program to fail, no matter how much speculation is done. An incorrect program, which formerly might have received a terminating excep- tion, will get an incorrect result. This is acceptable for some programs, assuming the compiler can also generate a normal version of the program, which does not speculate and can receive a terminating exception.

> 在保留异常的最简单方法中，硬件和操作系统在异常发生时简单地处理所有可恢复的异常，并简单地为任何可能导致终止的异常返回一个未定义的值。如果产生终止异常的指令不是推测性的，那么程序就出错了。请注意，不是终止程序，而是允许程序继续，尽管它几乎肯定会生成不正确的结果。如果产生终止异常的指令是推测性的，那么程序可能是正确的，推测性结果将不会被使用；因此，为指令返回未定义的值不会有害。这种方案永远不会导致正确的程序失败，无论进行多少推测。以前可能收到终止异常的不正确程序将得到不正确的结果。这对于某些程序来说是可以接受的，假设编译器也可以生成程序的正常版本，它不进行推测并且可以接收终止异常。

Example Consider that the following code fragment from an if-then-else statement of the form

Assume that the then clause is _almost always_ executed. Compile the code using compiler-based speculation. Assume R14 is unused and available.

Answer Here is the new code:

The then clause is completely speculated. We introduce a temporary register to avoid destroying R1 when B is loaded; if the load is speculative, R14 will be use- less. After the entire code segment is executed, A will be in R14. The else clause could have also been compiled speculatively with a conditional move, but if the branch is highly predictable and low cost, this might slow the code down, since two extra instructions would always be executed as opposed to one branch.

> 当时的子句是完全推测的。我们引入一个临时寄存器，以避免在加载 B 时销毁 R1；如果负载是投机性的，则 R14 将不再使用。执行整个代码段后，A 将在 R14 中。其他条款也可以通过有条件的举动进行投机，但是如果分支高度可预测且成本低，则可能会减慢代码的速度，因为始终将执行两个额外的说明而不是一个分支。

In such a scheme, it is not necessary to know that an instruction is speculative. Indeed, it is helpful only when a program is in error and receives a terminating exception on a normal instruction; in such cases, if the instruction were not marked as speculative, the program could be terminated.

> 在这样的方案中，不必知道指令是投机性的。实际上，只有在程序中出错并在正常指令上获得终止异常时，才有帮助；在这种情况下，如果未将指令标记为投机性，则可以终止该计划。

In this method for handling speculation, as in the next one, renaming will often be needed to prevent speculative instructions from destroying live values. Renam- ing is usually restricted to register values. Because of this restriction, the targets of stores cannot be destroyed and stores cannot be speculative. The small number of registers and the cost of spilling will act as one constraint on the amount of spec- ulation. Of course, the major constraint remains the cost of executing speculative instructions when the compiler’s branch prediction is incorrect.

> 在处理猜测的方法中，与下一个猜测一样，通常需要重命名以防止投机说明破坏实时价值。重命名通常仅限于寄存器值。由于这种限制，商店的目标不能被破坏，商店不能投机。少量注册表和溢出成本将是对规格数量的限制。当然，当编译器的分支预测不正确时，主要限制仍然是执行投机说明的成本。

A second approach to preserving exception behavior when speculating intro- duces speculative versions of instructions that do not generate terminating excep- tions and instructions to check for such exceptions. This combination preserves the exception behavior exactly.

> 推测引入性的指令的投机版本时，可以保留异常行为的第二种方法，这些版本不会生成终止的征收和指令以检查此类例外。这种组合完全保留了例外行为。

Example Show how the previous example can be coded using a speculative load (sLD) and a speculation check instruction (SPECCK) to completely preserve exception behav- ior. Assume R14 is unused and available.

> 示例说明如何使用投机载荷(SLD)和投机检查指令(SPECCK)对上一个示例进行编码，以完全保留异常行为。假设 R14 未使用并且可用。

_Answer_ Here is the code that achieves this:

Notice that the speculation check requires that we maintain a basic block for the then case. If we had speculated only a portion of the then case, then a basic block representing the then case would exist in any event. More importantly, notice that checking for a possible exception requires extra code.

> 请注意，投机检查要求我们为当时的情况维护一个基本块。如果我们仅推测了当时的情况的一部分，则在任何事件中都存在代表当时情况的基本块。更重要的是，请注意，检查可能的例外需要额外的代码。

A third approach for preserving exception behavior tracks exceptions as they occur but postpones any terminating exception until a value is actually used, pre- serving the occurrence of the exception, although not in a completely precise fash- ion. The scheme is simple: A poison bit is added to every register, and another bit is added to every instruction to indicate whether the instruction is speculative. The poison bit of the destination register is set whenever a speculative instruction results in a terminating exception; all other exceptions are handled immediately. If a speculative instruction uses a register with a poison bit turned on, the destina- tion register of the instruction simply has its poison bit turned on. If a normal instruction attempts to use a register source with its poison bit turned on, the instruction causes a fault. In this way, any program that would have generated an exception still generates one, albeit at the first instance where a result is used by an instruction that is not speculative. Since poison bits exist only on register values and not memory values, stores are never speculative and thus trap if either operand is "poison."

> 保留异常行为的第三种方法会在异常发生时对其进行跟踪，但会推迟任何终止异常，直到实际使用一个值，从而保留异常的发生，尽管不是以完全精确的方式。方案很简单：在每个寄存器中添加一个毒物位，并在每条指令中添加另一位以指示该指令是否是推测性的。每当推测指令导致终止异常时，都会设置目标寄存器的毒物位；所有其他异常都会立即处理。如果推测指令使用了一个毒物位打开的寄存器，则该指令的目标寄存器只是将其毒物位打开。如果一条普通指令试图使用其毒物位打开的寄存器源，则该指令会导致错误。通过这种方式，任何本应生成异常的程序仍会生成异常，尽管是在结果被非推测性指令使用的第一个实例中。由于毒物位只存在于寄存器值上而不存在于内存值上，因此存储永远不会是推测性的，因此如果任一操作数是 "毒物" 则陷入陷阱。

Example Consider the code fragment from page H-29 and show how it would be compiled with speculative instructions and poison bits. Show where an exception for the speculative memory reference would be recognized. Assume R14 is unused and available.

> 示例 考虑第 H-29 页的代码片段，并展示如何使用推测指令和毒物位对其进行编译。显示在何处识别推测内存引用的异常。假设 R14 未使用且可用。

_Answer_ Here is the code (an s preceding the opcode indicates a speculative instruction):

If the speculative sLD generates a terminating exception, the poison bit of R14 will be turned on. When the nonspeculative SW instruction occurs, it will raise an exception if the poison bit for R14 is on.

> 如果投机性 SLD 产生终止异常，则将打开 R14 的毒物位。当出现非负责 SW 指令时，如果 R14 的毒物位启动，它将引起例外。

One complication that must be overcome is how the OS saves the user registers on a context switch if the poison bit is set. A special instruction is needed to save and reset the state of the poison bits to avoid this problem.

> 必须克服的一个复杂性是，如果设置了毒物位，则操作系统如何保存用户寄存器在上下文开关上。需要特殊的指导来保存和重置毒物位的状态，以避免此问题。

The fourth and final approach listed earlier relies on a hardware mechanism that operates like a reorder buffer. In such an approach, instructions are marked by the compiler as speculative and include an indicator of how many branches the instruction was speculatively moved across and what branch action (taken/ not taken) the compiler assumed. This last piece of information basically tells the hardware the location of the code block where the speculated instruction orig- inally was. In practice, most of the benefit of speculation is gained by allowing movement across a single branch; thus, only 1 bit saying whether the speculated instruction came from the taken or not taken path is required. Alternatively, the original location of the speculative instruction is marked by a _sentinel_, which tells the hardware that the earlier speculative instruction is no longer speculative and values may be committed.

> 前面列出的第四种也是最后一种方法依赖于一种类似于重新排序缓冲区的硬件机制。在这种方法中，指令被编译器标记为推测性的，并且包括指令被推测性地移动了多少个分支以及编译器假设了哪些分支动作(采取/未采取)的指示符。最后一条信息基本上告诉硬件推测指令最初所在的代码块的位置。实际上，投机的大部分好处是通过允许跨单个分支移动来获得的；因此，只需要 1 位来说明推测的指令是否来自已采用或未采用的路径。或者，推测指令的原始位置由 *sentinel* 标记，它告诉硬件较早的推测指令不再是推测的并且可以提交值。

All instructions are placed in a reorder buffer when issued and are forced to commit in order, as in a hardware speculation approach. (Notice, though, that no actual speculative branch prediction or dynamic scheduling occurs.) The reor- der buffer tracks when instructions are ready to commit and delays the "write- back" portion of any speculative instruction. Speculative instructions are not allowed to commit until the branches that have been speculatively moved over are also ready to commit, or, alternatively, until the corresponding sentinel is reached. At that point, we know whether the speculated instruction should have been executed or not. If it should have been executed and it generated a terminating exception, then we know that the program should be terminated. If the instruction should not have been executed, then the exception can be ignored. Notice that the compiler, rather than the hardware, has the job of register renaming to ensure cor- rect usage of the speculated result, as well as correct program execution.

> 所有指令在发出时都放在重新排序缓冲区中，并强制按顺序提交，就像在硬件推测方法中一样。(但请注意，没有实际的推测分支预测或动态调度发生。)重新排序缓冲区跟踪指令何时准备好提交并延迟任何推测指令的 "回写" 部分。推测性指令不允许提交，直到已经被推测性移动的分支也准备好提交，或者，直到到达相应的哨兵。在这一点上，我们知道推测的指令是否应该被执行。如果它应该被执行并且它产生了一个终止异常，那么我们就知道程序应该被终止。如果不应该执行该指令，则可以忽略该异常。请注意，编译器而不是硬件具有寄存器重命名的工作，以确保正确使用推测的结果以及正确的程序执行。

### Hardware Support for Memory Reference Speculation

Moving loads across stores is usually done when the compiler is certain the addresses do not conflict. As we saw with the examples in Section 3.2, such trans- formations are critical to reducing the critical path length of a code segment. To allow the compiler to undertake such code motion when it cannot be absolutely certain that such a movement is correct, a special instruction to check for address conflicts can be included in the architecture. The special instruction is left at the original location of the load instruction (and acts like a guardian), and the load is moved up across one or more stores.

> 跨存储移动负载通常在编译器确定地址不冲突时完成。正如我们在第 3.2 节中的示例中看到的那样，此类转换对于减少代码段的关键路径长度至关重要。为了允许编译器在不能绝对确定此类移动是否正确时进行此类代码移动，可以在体系结构中包含一条用于检查地址冲突的特殊指令。特殊指令留在加载指令的原始位置(并充当监护人)，加载向上移动到一个或多个存储区。

When a speculated load is executed, the hardware saves the address of the accessed memory location. If a subsequent store changes the location before the check instruction, then the speculation has failed. If the location has not been touched, then the speculation is successful. Speculation failure can be handled in two ways. If only the load instruction was speculated, then it suffices to redo the load at the point of the check instruction (which could supply the target register in addition to the memory address). If additional instructions that depended on the load were also speculated, then a fix-up sequence that reexecutes all the speculated instructions starting with the load is needed. In this case, the check instruction specifies the address where the fix-up code is located.

> 执行推测加载时，硬件会保存访问的内存位置的地址。如果后续存储在检查指令之前更改位置，则推测失败。如果该位置没有被触及，则推测成功。推测失败可以通过两种方式处理。如果只推测加载指令，那么在检查指令点重做加载就足够了(除了内存地址外，它还可以提供目标寄存器)。如果还推测了依赖于负载的其他指令，则需要重新执行从负载开始的所有推测指令的修复序列。在这种情况下，检查指令指定修复代码所在的地址。

In this section, we have seen a variety of hardware assist mechanisms. Such mechanisms are key to achieving good support with the compiler-intensive approaches of [Chapter 3](#_bookmark93) and this appendix. In addition, several of them can be eas- ily integrated in the hardware-intensive approaches of [Chapter 3](#_bookmark93) and provide addi- tional benefits.
