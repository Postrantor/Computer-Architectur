## Concluding Remarks: What’s Ahead?

As 2000 began the focus on exploiting instruction-level parallelism was at its peak. In the first five years of the new century, it became clear that the ILP approach had likely peaked and that new approaches would be needed. By 2005 Intel and all the other major processor manufacturers had revamped their approach to focus on mul- ticore. Higher performance would be achieved through thread-level parallelism rather than instruction-level parallelism, and the responsibility for using the processor efficiently would largely shift from the hardware to the software and the programmer. This change was the most significant change in processor architec- ture since the early days of pipelining and instruction-level parallelism some 25 + years earlier.

> 随着 2000 年开始，专注于利用教学级并行性是达到顶峰的。在新世纪的前五年中，很明显，ILP 方法可能达到顶峰，需要新的方法。到 2005 年，英特尔和所有其他主要的处理器制造商都对关注 Multicore 的方法进行了改进。**通过线程级并行性而不是指令级并行性，将实现更高的性能，并且有效使用处理器的责任将在很大程度上从硬件转移到软件和程序员。**这种变化是自 25 年前的管道和指导级并行性的早期以来的处理器架构的最重大变化。

During the same period, designers began to explore the use of more data-level parallelism as another approach to obtaining performance. SIMD extensions enabled desktop and server microprocessors to achieve moderate performance increases for graphics and similar functions. More importantly, graphics proces- sing units (GPUs) pursued aggressive use of SIMD, achieving significant perfor- mance advantages for applications with extensive data-level parallelism. For scientific applications, such approaches represent a viable alternative to the more general, but less efficient, thread-level parallelism exploited in multicores. The next chapter explores these developments in the use of data-level parallelism.

> 在同一时期，设计师开始探索更多数据级并行性作为获得性能的另一种方法。SIMD 扩展使桌面和服务器微处理器能够实现图形和类似功能的中等性能。更重要的是，图形程序单元（GPU）追求对 SIMD 的积极使用，在具有广泛的数据级并行性的应用中获得了显着的表现优势。对于科学应用，这种方法代表了多具在多学院中利用的更一般但效率较低的线程水平并行性的可行替代方案。下一章探讨了使用数据级并行性的这些发展。

Many researchers predicted a major retrenchment in the use of ILP, predicting that two issue superscalar processors and larger numbers of cores would be the future. The advantages, however, of slightly higher issue rates and the ability of speculative dynamic scheduling to deal with unpredictable events, such as level- one cache misses, led to moderate ILP (typically about 4 issues/clock) being the primary building block in multicore designs. The addition of SMT and its effective- ness (both for performance and energy efficiency) further cemented the position of the moderate issue, out-of-order, speculative approaches. Indeed, even in the embedded market, the newest processors (e.g., the ARM Cortex-A9 and Cortex- A73) have introduced dynamic scheduling, speculation, and wider issues rates.

> 许多研究人员预测使用 ILP 的重大裁员，预测两个问题超量表处理器和大量核心将是未来。然而，优势的问题率略高，投机性动态调度的能力处理不可预测的事件，例如级别的缓存失误，导致中度 ILP（通常大约 4 期/时钟）是多核心中的主要构建块设计。SMT 及其有效性（用于性能和能源效率）进一步巩固了中等问题，排序，投机方法的位置。确实，即使在嵌入式市场中，最新的处理器（例如 ARM Cortex-A9 和 Cortex-A73）也引入了动态调度，投机和更广泛的问题。

It is highly unlikely that future processors will try to increase the width of issue significantly. It is simply too inefficient from the viewpoint of silicon utilization and power efficiency. Consider the data in [Figure 3.46](#_bookmark154) that show the five proces- sors in the IBM Power series. Over more than a decade, there has been a modest improvement in the ILP support in the Power processors, but the dominant portion of the increase in transistor count (a factor of more than 10 from the Power4 to the Power8) went to increasing the caches and the number of cores per die. Even the expansion in SMT support seems to be more of a focus than is an increase in the ILP throughput: The ILP structure from Power4 to Power8 went from 5 issues to 8, from 8 functional units to 16 (but not increasing from the original 2 load/store units), whereas the SMT support went from nonexistent to 8 threads/processor. A similar trend can be observed across the six generations of i7 processors, where almost all the additional silicon has gone to supporting more cores. The next two chapters focus on approaches that exploit data-level and thread-level parallelism.

> 未来的处理器极不可能大大提高问题的宽度。从硅利用率和功率效率的角度来看，这简直太效率了。考虑[图 3.46]（#_ bookmark154）中显示 IBM 功率系列中五个过程的数据。十多年来，电源处理器的 ILP 支持取得了适度的改善，但是晶体管数量增加的主要部分（从电源 4 到 Power8 的 10 倍以上）用于增加缓存。和每个死亡的核心数。即使是 SMT 支持的扩展也似乎更是一个重点，而不是 ILP 吞吐量的增加：ILP 结构从 Power4 到 Power8 的 ILP 结构从 5 期开始从 5 期开始，从 8 个功能单元增加到 16（但不增加原始 2 加载/存储单元），而 SMT 支持从不存在到 8 个线程/处理器。在六代 i7 处理器中，可以观察到类似的趋势，几乎所有其他硅都已经支持更多核心。接下来的两章重点介绍了利用数据级和线程级并行性的方法。

Figure 3.46 Characteristics of five generations of IBM Power processors. All except the Power6, which is static and in-order, were dynamically scheduled; all the processors support two load/store pipelines. The Power6 has the same functional units as the Power5 except for a decimal unit. Power7 and Power8 use embedded DRAM for the L3 cache. Power9 has been described briefly; it further expands the caches and supports off-chip HBM.
