## Exercises

Solutions to "starred" exercises are available for instructors who register at `text- books.elsevier.com.`

✪ F.1 \[15] &lt;F.2, F.3 &gt;Is electronic communication always faster than nonelectronic means for longer distances? Calculate the time to send 1000 GB using 25 8-mm

tapes and an overnight delivery service versus sending 1000 GB by FTP over the Internet. Make the following four assumptions:

- The tapes are picked up at 4 P.M. Pacific time and delivered 4200 km away at 10 A.M. Eastern time (7 A.M. Pacific time).
- On one route the slowest link is a T3 line, which transfers at 45 Mbits/sec.
- On another route the slowest link is a 100-Mbit/sec Ethernet.
- You can use 50% of the slowest link between the two sites.
  Will all the bytes sent by either Internet route arrive before the overnight delivery person arrives?

✪ F.2 \[10] &lt;F.2, F.3 &gt;For the same assumptions as Exercise F.1, what is the bandwidth of overnight delivery for a 1000-GB package?

✪ F.3 \[10] &lt;F.2, F.3 &gt;For the same assumptions as Exercise F.1, what is the minimum bandwidth of the slowest link to beat overnight delivery? What standard network

options match that speed?

✪ F.4 \[15] &lt;F.2, F.3 &gt;The original Ethernet standard was for 10 Mbits/sec and a max- imum distance of 2.5 km. How many bytes could be in flight in the original Ether-

net? Assume you can use 90% of the peak bandwidth.

✪ F.5 \[15] &lt;F.2, F.3 &gt;Flow control is a problem for WANs due to the long time of flight, as the example on page F-14 illustrates. Ethernet did not include flow

control when it was first standardized at 10 Mbits/sec. Calculate the number of bytes in flight for a 10-Gbit/sec Ethernet over a 100 meter link, assuming you can use 90% of peak bandwidth. What does your answer mean for network designers?

✪ F.6 \[15] &lt;F.2, F.3 &gt;Assume the total overhead to send a zero-length data packet on an Ethernet is 100 μs and that an unloaded network can transmit at 90% of the peak 1000-Mbit/sec rating. For the purposes of this question, assume that the size of the

Ethernet header and trailer is 56 bytes. Assume a continuous stream of packets of the same size. Plot the delivered bandwidth of user data in Mbits/sec as the payload data size varies from 32 bytes to the maximum size of 1500 bytes in 32-byte increments.

✪ F.7 \[10] &lt;F.2, F.3 &gt;Exercise F.6 suggests that the delivered Ethernet bandwidth to a single user may be disappointing. Making the same assumptions as in that exercise,

by how much would the maximum payload size have to be increased to deliver half of the peak bandwidth?

✪ F.8 \[10] &lt;F.2, F.3 &gt;One reason that ATM has a fixed transfer size is that when a short message is behind a long message, a node may need to wait for an entire

transfer to complete. For applications that are time sensitive, such as when transmitting voice or video, the large transfer size may result in transmission delays that are too long for the application. On an unloaded interconnection, what is the worstcase delay in microseconds if a node must wait for one full-size Ethernet packet versus an ATM transfer? See [Figure F.30](#_bookmark627) (page F- 78) to find the packet sizes. For this question assume that you can transmit at 100% of the 622-Mbits/sec ATM network and 100% of the 1000-Mbit/ sec Ethernet.

✪ F.9 \[10] &lt;F.2, F.3 &gt;Exercise F.7 suggests the need for expanding the maximum pay-load to increase the delivered bandwidth, but Exercise F.8 suggests the

impact on worst-case latency of making it longer. What would be the impact on latency of increasing the maximum payload size by the answer to Exercise F.7?

✪ F.10 \[12/12/20] &lt;F.4 &gt;The Omega network shown in [Figure F.11](#_bookmark609) on page F-31 con- sists of three columns of four switches, each with two inputs and two outputs. Each

switch can be set to `straight`, which connects the upper switch input to the upper switch output and the lower input to the lower output, and to `exchange,` which con- nects the upper input to the lower output and `vice versa` for the lower input. For each column of switches, label the inputs and outputs 0, 1, …, 7 from top to bottom, to correspond with the numbering of the processors.

1. \[12] &lt;F.4 &gt;When a switch is set to exchange and a message passes through, what is the relationship between the label values for the switch input and output
   used by the message? (_Hint_: Think in terms of operations on the digits of the binary representation of the label number.)
2. \[12] &lt;F.4 &gt;Between any two switches in adjacent columns that are connected by a link, what is the relationship between the label of the output connected to
   the input?
3. \[20] &lt;F.4 &gt;Based on your results in parts (a) and (b), design and describe a simple routing scheme for distributed control of the Omega network. A message
   will carry a `routing tag` computed by the sending processor. Describe how the processor computes the tag and how each switch can set itself by examining a bit of the routing tag.

✪ F.11 \[12/12/12/12/12/12] &lt;F.4 &gt;Prove whether or not it is possible to realize the fol- lowing permutations (i.e., communication patterns) on the eight-node Omega net-

work shown in [Figure F.11](#_bookmark609) on page F-31:

1. \[12] &lt;F.4 &gt;Bit-reversal permutation—the node with binary coordinates `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—1</sub>, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—2</sub>, …, `a`<sub>1</sub>, `a`<sub>0</sub> communicates with the node `a`<sub>0</sub>, `a`<sub>1</sub>, …, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—2</sub>, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—1</sub>.
2. \[12] &lt;F.4 &gt;Perfect shuffle permutation—the node with binary coordinates `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—1</sub>, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—2</sub>, …, `a`<sub>1</sub>, `a`<sub>0</sub> communicates with the node `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—2</sub>, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—3</sub>, …, `a`<sub>0</sub>, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—1</sub> (i.e., rotate left 1 bit).
3. \[12] &lt;F.4 &gt;Bit-complement permutation—the node with binary coordinates `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—1</sub>, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—2</sub>, …, `a`<sub>1</sub>, `a`<sub>0</sub> communicates with the node `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—1</sub>, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—2</sub>,…, `a`<sub>1</sub>, `a`<sub>0</sub> (i.e., complement each bit).
4. \[12] &lt;F.4 &gt;Butterfly permutation—the node with binary coordinates `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—1</sub>, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—2</sub>, …, `a`<sub>1</sub>, `a`<sub>0</sub> communicates with the node `a`<sub>0</sub>, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—2</sub>, …, `a`<sub>1</sub>, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—1</sub> (i.e., swap the most and least significant bits).
5. \[12] &lt;F.4 &gt;Matrix transpose permutation—the node with binary coordinates `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—1</sub>, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—2</sub>, …, `a`<sub>1</sub>, `a`<sub>0</sub> communicates with the node `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>/2—1</sub>, …, `a`<sub>0</sub>, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>—1</sub>, …, `a<sub>n</sub>`<sub>/2</sub> (i.e., transpose the bits in positions approximately halfway around).
6. \[12] &lt;F.4 &gt;Barrel-shift permutation—node `i` communicates with node `i+` 1 modulo `N` — 1, where `N` is the total number of nodes and 0 ≤ `i`.
   ✪ F.12 \[12] &lt;F.4 &gt;Design a network topology using 18-port crossbar switches that has the minimum number of switches to connect 64 nodes. Each switch port supports

communication to and from one device.

✪ F.13 \[15] &lt;F.4 &gt;Design a network topology that has the minimum latency through the switches for 64 nodes using 18-port crossbar switches. Assume unit delay in the

switches and zero delay for wires.

✪ F.14 \[15] &lt;F.4 &gt;Design a switch topology that balances the bandwidth required for all links for 64 nodes using 18-port crossbar switches. Assume a uniform traffic

pattern.

✪ F.15 \[15] &lt;F.4 &gt;Compare the interconnection latency of a crossbar, Omega network, and fat tree with eight nodes. Use [Figure F.11](#_bookmark609) on page F-31, [Figure F.12](#_bookmark610) on page F-

33, and [Figure F.14](#_bookmark612) on page F-37. Assume that the fat tree is built entirely from two-input, two-output switches so that its hardware resources are more comparable to that of the Omega network. Assume that each switch costs a unit time delay. Assume that the fat tree randomly picks a path, so give the best case and worst case for each example. How long will it take to send a message from node 0 to node 6? How long will it take node 1 and node 7 to communicate?

✪ F.16 \[15] &lt;F.4 &gt;Draw the topology of a 6-cube after the same manner of the 4-cube in [Figure F.14](#_bookmark612) on page F-37. What is the maximum and average number of hops

needed by packets assuming a uniform distribution of packet destinations?

✪ F.17 \[15] &lt;F.4 &gt;Complete a table similar to Figure F.15 on page F-40 that captures the performance and cost of various network topologies, but do it for the general case of `N` nodes using `k` × `k` switches instead of the specific case of 64 nodes.

✪ F.18 \[20] &lt;F.4 &gt;Repeat the example given on page F-41, but use the bit-complement communication pattern given in Exercise F.11 instead of NEWS communication.

✪ F.19 \[15] &lt;F.5 &gt;Give the four specific conditions necessary for deadlock to exist in an interconnection network. Which of these are removed by dimension-order routing?

Which of these are removed in adaptive routing with the use of "escape" routing paths? Which of these are removed in adaptive routing with the technique of dead- lock recovery (regressive or progressive)? Explain your answer.

✪ F.20 \[12/12/12/12] &lt;F.5 &gt;Prove whether or not the following routing algorithms based on prohibiting dimensional turns are suitable to be used as escape paths for 2D

meshes by analyzing whether they are both connected and deadlock-free. Explain your answer. (_Hint_: You may wish to refer to the Turn Model algorithm and/or to prove your answer by drawing a directed graph for a 4 4 mesh that depicts depen- dencies between channels and verifying the channel dependency graph is free of cycles.) The routing algorithms are expressed with the following abbreviations:

W=west, E=east, N=north, and S =south.

1. \[12] &lt;F.5 &gt;Allowed turns are from W to N, E to N, S to W,
   and S to E.
2. \[12] &lt;F.5 &gt;Allowed turns are from W to S, E to S, N to E,
   and S to E.
3. \[12] &lt;F.5 &gt;Allowed turns are from W to S, E to S, N to W, S
   to E, W to N, and S to W.
4. \[12] &lt;F.5 &gt;Allowed turns are from S to E, E to S, S to W, N to W, N to E, and E to N.
   ✪ F.21 \[15] &lt;F.5 &gt;Compute and compare the upper bound for the efficiency factor, ρ, for dimension-order routing and up\*/down\* routing assuming uniformly distributed

traffic on a 64-node 2D mesh network. For up\*/down\* routing, assume optimal placement of the root node (i.e., a node near the middle of the mesh). (_Hint_: You will have to find the loading of links across the network bisection that carries the global load as determined by the routing algorithm.)

✪ F.22 \[15] &lt;F.5 &gt;For the same assumptions as Exercise F.21, find the efficiency factor for up\*/down\* routing on a 64-node fat tree network using 4 4 switches. Com- pare this result with the ρ found for up\*/down\* routing on a 2D mesh. Explain.

✪ F.23 \[15] &lt;F.5 &gt;Calculate the probability of matching two-phased arbitration requests from all `k` input ports of a switch simultaneously to the `k` output ports assuming a

uniform distribution of requests and grants to/from output ports. How does this compare to the matching probability for three-phased arbitration in which each of the `k` input ports can make two simultaneous requests (again, assuming a uni- form random distribution of requests and grants)?

✪ F.24 \[15] &lt; F.5 &gt;The equation on page F-52 shows the value of cut-through switching. Ethernet switches used to build clusters often do not support cut-through switching.

Compare the time to transfer 1500 bytes over a 1000-Mbit/sec Ethernet with and without cut-through switching for a 64-node cluster. Assume that each Ethernet switch takes 1.0 μs and that a message goes through seven intermediate switches.

✪ F.25 \[15] &lt;F.5 &gt;Making the same assumptions as in Exercise F.24, what is the differ- ence between cut-through and store-and-forward switching for 32 bytes?

✪ F.26 \[15] &lt;F.5 &gt;One way to reduce latency is to use larger switches. Unlike Exercise F.24, let’s assume we need only three intermediate switches to connect any two

nodes in the cluster. Make the same assumptions as in Exercise F.24 for the remain- ing parameters. What is the difference between cut-through and store-and-forward for 1500 bytes? For 32 bytes?

✪ F.27 \[20] &lt;F.5 &gt;Using FlexSim 1.2 ([_http://ceng.usc.edu/smart/FlexSim/flexsim.html_)](http://ceng.usc.edu/smart/FlexSim/flexsim.html)) or some other cycle-accurate network simulator, simulate a 256-node 2D torus net-

work assuming wormhole routing, 32-flit packets, uniform (random) communica- tion pattern, and four virtual channels. Compare the performance of deterministic routing using DOR, adaptive routing using escape paths (i.e., Duato’s Protocol), and true fully adaptive routing using progressive deadlock recovery (i.e., Disha routing). Do so by plotting latency versus applied load and through-put versus applied load for each, as is done in [Figure F.19](#_bookmark616) for the example on page F-53. Also run simulations and plot results for two and eight virtual channels for each. Com- pare and explain your results by addressing how/why the number and use of virtual channels by the various routing algorithms affect network performance. (_Hint_: Be sure to let the simulation reach steady state by allowing a warm-up period of a sev- eral thousand network cycles before gathering results.)

✪ F.28 \[20] &lt;F.5 &gt;Repeat Exercise F.27 using bit-reversal communication instead of the uniform random communication pattern. Compare and explain your results by

addressing how/why the communication pattern affects network performance.

✪ F.29 \[40] &lt;F.5 &gt;Repeat Exercises F.27 and F.28 using 16-flit packets and 128-flit packets. Compare and explain your results by addressing how/why the packet size

along with the other design parameters affect network performance.

F.30 \[20] &lt;F.2, F.4, F.5, F.8 &gt;Figures F.7, F.16, and F.20 show interconnection network characteristics of several of the top 500 supercomputers by machine type

as of the publication of the fourth edition. Update that figure to the most recent top

500\. How have the systems and their networks changed since the data in the orig- inal figure? Do similar comparisons for OCNs used in microprocessors and SANs targeted for clusters using Figures F.29 and F.31.

✪ F.31 \[12/12/12/15/15/18] &lt;F.8 &gt;Use the M/M/1 queuing model to answer this exer- cise. Measurements of a network bridge show that packets arrive at 200 packets

per second and that the gateway forwards them in about 2 ms.

1. \[12] &lt;F.8 &gt;What is the utilization of the gateway?
2. \[12] &lt;F.8 &gt;What is the mean number of packets in the
   gateway?
3. \[12] &lt;F.8 &gt;What is the mean time spent in the gateway?
4. \[15] &lt;F.8 &gt;Plot response time versus utilization as you vary
   the arrival rate.
5. \[15] &lt;F.8 &gt;For an M/M/1 queue, the probability of finding
   `n` or more tasks in the system is Utilization*<sup>n</sup>*. What
   is the chance of an overflow of the FIFO if it can
   hold 10 messages?
6. \[18] &lt;F.8 &gt;How big must the gateway be to have packet loss
   due to FIFO over- flow less than one packet per million?
   ✪ F.32 \[20] &lt;F.8 &gt;The imbalance between the time of sending and receiving can cause problems in network performance. Sending too fast can cause the network to back

up and increase the latency of messages, since the receivers will not be able to pull out the message fast enough. A technique called `bandwidth matching` proposes a simple solution: Slow down the sender so that it matches the performance of the receiver \[[Brewer and Kuszmaul 1994](#_bookmark645)]. If two machines exchange an equal number of messages using a protocol like UDP, one will get ahead of the other, causing it to send all its messages first. After the receiver puts all these messages away, it will then send its messages. Estimate the performance for this case versus a bandwidth- matched case. Assume that the send overhead is 200 μs, the receive overhead is 300 μs, time of flight is 5 μs, latency is 10 μs, and that the two machines want to exchange 100 messages.

F.33 \[40] &lt;F.8 &gt;Compare the performance of UDP with and without bandwidth matching by slowing down the UDP send code to match the receive code as advised by bandwidth matching \[[Brewer and Kuszmaul 1994](#_bookmark645)]. Devise an exper-

iment to see how much performance changes as a result. How should you change the send rate when two nodes send to the same destination? What if one sender sends to two destinations?

✪ F.34 \[40] &lt;F.6, F.8 &gt;If you have access to an SMP and a cluster, write a program to measure latency of communication and bandwidth of communication between pro-

cessors, as was plotted in [Figure F.32](#_bookmark628) on page F-80.

1. \[20/20/20] &lt;F.9 &gt;If you have access to a UNIX system, use
   ping to explore the Internet. First read the manual page. Then use
   ping without option flags to be sure you can reach the following
   sites. It should say that X is alive. Depending on your system, you
   may be able to see the path by setting the flags to verbose mode
   (-v) and trace route mode (-R) to see the path between your machine and the example machine. Alternatively, you may need to use the program trace route to see the path. If so, try its manual page. You may want to use the UNIX command script to make a record of your session.
2. \[20] &lt;F.9 &gt;Trace the route to another machine on the same local area network. What is the latency?
3. \[20] &lt;F.9 &gt;Trace the route to another machine on your campus that is `not` on the same local area network.What is the latency?
4. \[20] &lt;F.9 &gt;Trace the route to another machine `off campus`. For example, if you have a friend you send email to, try tracing that route. See if you can discover
   what types of networks are used along that route.What is the latency?
5. \[15] &lt;F.9 &gt;Use FTP to transfer a file from a remote site and then between local sites on the same LAN. What is the difference in bandwidth for each transfer? Try
   the transfer at different times of day or days of the week. Is the WAN or LAN the bottleneck?

✪ F.37 \[10/10] &lt;F.9, F.11 &gt;Figure F.41 on page F-93 compares latencies for a high- bandwidth network with high overhead and a low-bandwidth network with low

overhead for different TCP/IP message sizes.

1. \[10] &lt;F.9, F.11 &gt;For what message sizes is the delivered bandwidth higher for the high-bandwidth network?
2. \[10] &lt;F.9, F.11 &gt;For your answer to part (a), what is the delivered bandwidth for each network?
   ✪ F.38 \[15] &lt;F.9, F.11 &gt;Using the statistics in Figure F.41 on page F-93, estimate the per-message overhead for each network.

✪ F.39 \[15] &lt;F.9, F.11 &gt;Exercise F.37 calculates which message sizes are faster for two networks with different overhead and peak bandwidth. Using the statistics in

Figure F.41 on page F-93, what is the percentage of messages that are transmitted more quickly on the network with low overhead and bandwidth? What is the per- centage of data transmitted more quickly on the network with high overhead and bandwidth?

✪ F.40 \[15] &lt;F.9, F.11 &gt;One interesting measure of the latency and bandwidth of an inter-connection is to calculate the size of a message needed to achieve one-half

of the peak bandwidth. This halfway point is sometimes referred to as `n`<sub>1/2</sub>, taken from the terminology of vector processing. Using Figure F.41 on page F-93, esti- mate `n`<sub>1/2</sub> for TCP/IP message using 155-Mbit/sec ATM and 10-Mbit/sec Ethernet.

1. \[Discussion] &lt;F.10 &gt;The Google cluster used to be constructed from 1 rack unit (RU) PCs, each with one processor and two disks. Today there are considerably
   denser options. How much less floor space would it take if we were to replace the 1 RU PCs with modern alternatives? Go to the Compaq or Dell Web sites to find the densest alternative. What would be the estimated impact on cost of the equipment? What would be the estimated impact on rental cost of floor space?

What would be the impact on interconnection network design for achieving power/ performance efficiency?

1. \[Discussion] &lt;F.13 &gt;At the time of the writing of the fourth
   edition, it was unclear what would happen with Ethernet versus
   InfiniBand versus Advanced Switching in the machine room. What are
   the technical advantages of each? What are the eco-
   nomic advantages of each? Why would people maintaining the system prefer one to the other? How popular is each network today? How do they compare to proprietary commercial networks such as Myrinet and Quadrics?
