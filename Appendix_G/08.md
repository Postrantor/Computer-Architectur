The CDC STAR processor and its descendant, the CYBER 205, were memory- memory vector processors. To keep the hardware simple and support the high bandwidth requirements (up to three memory references per floating-point opera- tion), these processors did not efficiently handle non-unit stride. While most loops have unit stride, a non-unit stride loop had poor performance on these processors because memory-to-memory data movements were required to gather together (and scatter back) the nonadjacent vector elements; these operations used special scatter-gather instructions. In addition, there was special support for sparse vectors that used a bit vector to represent the zeros and nonzeros and a dense vector of nonzero values. These more complex vector operations were slow because of the long memory latency, and it was often faster to use scalar mode for sparse or non-unit stride operations. [Schneck \[1987\]](#_bookmark715) described several of the early pipe- lined processors (e.g., Stretch) through the first vector processors, including the 205 and Cray-1. [Dongarra \[1986\]](#_bookmark706) did another good survey, focusing on more recent processors.

> CDC 星处理器及其后代网络 205 是内存 - 内存矢量处理器。为了保持硬件简单并支持高带宽要求(每个浮点操作操作最多三个内存引用)，这些处理器没有有效地处理非单元步伐。虽然大多数循环都有单位步伐，但非单元步长循环在这些处理器上的性能较差，因为需要内存到内存的数据移动来聚集(并散射)非相邻矢量元素；这些操作使用了特殊的散点图说明。此外，对稀疏向量也有特殊的支持，这些向量使用位向量表示零和非齐射线以及非零值的密集向量。这些更复杂的矢量操作由于长期记忆潜伏期而缓慢，并且使用标量模式进行稀疏或非单位步幅操作通常更快。[Schneck \ [1987 \]](#_ bookmark715)描述了一些早期管道衬里的处理器(例如，拉伸)穿过第一个矢量处理器，包括 205 和 cray-1。[Dongarra \ [1986 \]](#_ Bookmark706)进行了另一项很好的调查，重点是最新的处理器。

The 1980s also saw the arrival of smaller-scale vector processors, called mini-supercomputers. Priced at roughly one-tenth the cost of a supercomputer ($0.5 to $1 million versus $5 to $10 million), these processors caught on quickly. Although many companies joined the market, the two companies that were most successful were Convex and Alliant. Convex started with the uniprocessor C-1 vector processor and then offered a series of small multiprocessors, ending with the C-4 announced in 1994. The keys to the success of Convex over this period were their emphasis on Cray software capability, the effectiveness of their com- piler (see Figure G.9), and the quality of their UNIX OS implementation. The C-4 was the last vector machine Convex sold; they switched to making large-scale multiprocessors using Hewlett-Packard RISC microprocessors and were bought by HP in 1995. [Alliant \[1987\]](#_bookmark702) concentrated more on the multiprocessor aspects; they built an eight-processor computer, with each processor offering vector capability. Alliant ceased operation in the early 1990s.

> 1980 年代还看到了较小规模的矢量处理器的到来，称为 Mini-SuperCuputer。这些处理器的价格大约是超级计算机成本的十分之一(0.5 至 100 万美元与 1000 万美元)，这些处理器很快就抓住了。尽管许多公司加入了市场，但最成功的两家公司都是凸面和同样的。凸点从 UniProcessor C-1 矢量处理器开始，然后提供了一系列的小型多处理器，结束于 1994 年宣布的 C-4。他们的合并器(见图 G.9)及其 UNIX OS 实施的质量。C-4 是售出的最后一台矢量机凸。他们使用惠普(Hewlett-Packard RISC)微处理器切换到制造大规模的多处理器，并于 1995 年被 HP 购买。[Alliant \ [1987 \]](#_ bookmark702)更多地集中在多处理器方面；他们构建了一台八处理器计算机，每个处理器都提供矢量功能。Alliant 在 1990 年代初停止了运营。

In the early 1980s, CDC spun out a group, called ETA, to build a new super- computer, the ETA-10, capable of 10 GFLOPS. The ETA processor was delivered in the late 1980s (see [Fazio \[1987\]](#_bookmark708)) and used low-temperature CMOS in a

configuration with up to 10 processors. Each processor retained the memory- memory architecture based on the CYBER 205. Although the ETA-10 achieved enormous peak performance, its scalar speed was not comparable. In 1989, CDC, the first supercomputer vendor, closed ETA and left the supercomputer design business.

> 配置最多 10 个处理器。每个处理器都基于网络 205 保留了内存 - 内存架构。尽管 ETA-10 达到了巨大的峰值性能，但其标量速度并不可比。1989 年，CDC 是第一个超级计算机供应商，关闭了 ETA，并离开了超级计算机设计业务。

In 1986, IBM introduced the System/370 vector architecture (see [Moore et al.](#_bookmark713) [\[1987\]](#_bookmark713)) and its first implementation in the 3090 Vector Facility. The architecture extended the System/370 architecture with 171 vector instructions. The 3090/VF was integrated into the 3090 CPU. Unlike most other vector processors of the time, the 3090/VF routed its vectors through the cache. The IBM 370 machines contin- ued to evolve over time and are now called the IBM zSeries. The vector extensions have been removed from the architecture and some of the opcode space was reused to implement 64-bit address extensions.

> 1986 年，IBM 介绍了系统/370 矢量体系结构(请参阅[Moore 等](#_ bookmark713)[\ [1987 \]](#_ bookmark713))及其在 3090 矢量设施中的首次实现。该体系结构通过 171 个向量说明扩展了系统/370 体系结构。将 3090/VF 集成到 3090 CPU 中。与当时的大多数其他矢量处理器不同，3090/vf 通过缓存路由其向量。IBM 370 机器继续演化，现在被称为 IBM ZSeries。向量扩展已从架构中删除，并将某些 OpCode 空间重新使用以实现 64 位地址扩展。

In late 1989, Cray Research was split into two companies, both aimed at build- ing high-end processors available in the early 1990s. Seymour Cray headed the spin-off, Cray Computer Corporation, until its demise in 1995. Their initial pro- cessor, the Cray-3, was to be implemented in gallium arsenide, but they were unable to develop a reliable and cost-effective implementation technology. A sin- gle Cray-3 prototype was delivered to the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) for evaluation purposes in 1993, but no paying customers were found for the design. The Cray-4 prototype, which was to have been the first pro- cessor to run at 1 GHz, was close to completion when the company filed for bank- ruptcy. Shortly before his tragic death in a car accident in 1996, Seymour Cray started yet another company, SRC Computers, to develop high-performance sys- tems but this time using commodity components. In 2000, SRC announced the SRC-6 system, which combined 512 Intel microprocessors, 5 billion gates of reconfigurable logic, and a high-performance vector-style memory system.

> 1989 年末，克雷研究分为两家公司，均旨在建立 1990 年代初期的高端处理器。西摩·克雷(Seymour Cray)领导衍生公司 Cray 计算机公司(Cray Computer Corporation)，直到 1995 年去世。其最初的专业人员 Cray-3 将在 Arsenide 中实施，但他们无法开发可靠且具有成本效益的实施技术。1993 年，将 Single Cray-3 原型交付给国家大气研究中心(NCAR)进行评估，但没有发现该设计的付费客户。Cray-4 原型将是第一个以 1 GHz 运行的专业人士，当该公司申请银行 Ruptcy 时，它接近完成。西摩·克雷(Seymour Cray)在 1996 年发生的一场车祸中悲惨死亡前不久，创立了另一家公司 SRC Computers，以开发高性能系统，但这次使用商品组件。2000 年，SRC 宣布了 SRC-6 系统，该系统结合了 512 个 Intel 微处理器，50 亿个可重构逻辑和高性能向量矢量式存储系统。

Cray Research focused on the C90, a new high-end processor with up to 16 processors and a clock rate of 240 MHz. This processor was delivered in 1991. The J90 was a CMOS-based vector machine using DRAM memory starting at $250,000, but with typical configurations running about $1 million. In mid- 1995, Cray Research was acquired by Silicon Graphics, and in 1998 released the SV1 system, which grafted considerably faster CMOS processors onto the J90 memory system, and which also added a data cache for vectors to each CPU to help meet the increased memory bandwidth demands. The SV1 also intro- duced the MSP concept, which was developed to provide competitive single-CPU performance by ganging together multiple slower CPUs. Silicon Graphics sold Cray Research to Tera Computer in 2000, and the joint company was renamed Cray Inc.

The basis for modern vectorizing compiler technology and the notion of data dependence was developed by [Kuck and his colleagues \[1974\]](#_bookmark710) at the University of Illinois. [Banerjee \[1979\]](#_bookmark704) developed the test named after him. [Padua and Wolfe](#_bookmark714) [\[1986\]](#_bookmark714) gave a good overview of vectorizing compiler technology.

Benchmark studies of various supercomputers, including attempts to under- stand the performance differences, have been undertaken by [Lubeck, Moore,](#_bookmark711) [and Mendez \[1985\], Bucher \[1983\]](#_bookmark711), and [Jordan \[1987\]](#_bookmark709). There are several bench- mark suites aimed at scientific usage and often employed for supercomputer benchmarking, including Linpack and the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories FOR- TRAN kernels. The University of Illinois coordinated the collection of a set of benchmarks for supercomputers, called the Perfect Club. In 1993, the Perfect Club was integrated into SPEC, which released a set of benchmarks, SPEChpc96, aimed at high-end scientific processing in 1996. The NAS parallel benchmarks developed at the NASA Ames Research Center \[[Bailey et al. 1991](#_bookmark703)\] have become a popular set of kernels and applications used for supercomputer evaluation. A new benchmark suite, HPC Challenge, was introduced consisting of a few kernels that stress machine memory and interconnect bandwidths in addition to floating-point perfor- mance \[[Luszczek et al. 2005](#_bookmark712)\]. Although standard supercomputer benchmarks are useful as a rough measure of machine capabilities, large supercomputer purchases are generally preceded by a careful performance evaluation on the actual mix of applications required at the customer site.
