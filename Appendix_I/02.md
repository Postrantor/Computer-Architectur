## Interprocessor Communication: The Critical Performance Issue

In multiprocessors with larger processor counts, interprocessor communication becomes more expensive, since the distance between processors increases. Furthermore, in truly parallel applications where the threads of the application must communicate, there is usually more communication than in a loosely coupled set of distinct processes or independent transactions, which characterize many commercial server applications. These factors combine to make efficient interpro- cessor communication one of the most important determinants of parallel perfor- mance, especially for the scientific market.

> 在具有**较大处理器计数的多处理器中，由于处理器之间的距离增加，处理器通信变得更加昂贵**。此外，在应用程序线程必须进行通信的真正并行应用中，通常比在一组松散耦合的不同流程或独立交易的集合中要多得多，这些过程表征了许多商业服务器应用程序。这些因素结合起来，使高效的间交流成为平行绩效的最重要决定因素之一，尤其是对于科学市场而言。

Unfortunately, characterizing the communication needs of an application and the capabilities of an architecture is complex. This section examines the key hard- ware characteristics that determine communication performance, while the next section looks at application behavior and communication needs.

> 不幸的是，表征应用程序的通信需求和架构的功能很复杂。本节介绍了确定通信性能的关键硬件特征，而下一节则关注应用程序行为和通信需求。

Three performance metrics are critical in any hardware communication mechanism:

> 三个性能指标在任何硬件通信机制中都是至关重要的：

1. `Communication bandwidth`—Ideally, the communication bandwidth is limited by processor, memory, and interconnection bandwidths, rather than by some aspect of the communication mechanism. The interconnection network deter- mines the maximum communication capacity of the system. The bandwidth in or out of a single node, which is often as important as total system bandwidth, is affected both by the architecture within the node and by the communication mechanism. How does the communication mechanism affect the communica- tion bandwidth of a node? When communication occurs, resources within the nodes involved in the communication are tied up or occupied, preventing other outgoing or incoming communication. When this `occupancy` is incurred for each word of a message, it sets an absolute limit on the communication band- width. This limit is often lower than what the network or memory system can provide. Occupancy may also have a component that is incurred for each com- munication event, such as an incoming or outgoing request. In the latter case, the occupancy limits the communication rate, and the impact of the occupancy on overall communication bandwidth depends on the size of the messages.

> 1. `通信带宽`——理想情况下，通信带宽受限于处理器、内存和互连带宽，而不是通信机制的某些方面。互连网络决定了系统的最大通信容量。进出单个节点的带宽通常与总系统带宽一样重要，受节点内架构和通信机制的影响。通信机制如何影响节点的通信带宽？ 当通信发生时，参与通信的节点内的资源被捆绑或占用，从而阻止其他传出或传入通信。当消息的每个词都产生这种 "占用" 时，它就对通信带宽设置了绝对限制。此限制通常低于网络或内存系统可以提供的限制。占用也可能有一个组件，它会因每个通信事件而发生，例如传入或传出请求。在后一种情况下，占用率限制了通信速率，并且占用率对整体通信带宽的影响取决于消息的大小。

2. `Communication latency`—Ideally, the latency is as low as possible. As [Appendix F](#_bookmark595) explains: Communication latency Sender overhead + Time of flight + Transmission time + Receiver overhead assuming no contention. Time of flight is fixed and transmission time is deter- mined by the interconnection network. The software and hardware overheads in sending and receiving messages are largely determined by the communication mechanism and its implementation. Why is latency crucial? Latency affects both performance and how easy it is to program a multiprocessor. Unless latency is hidden, it directly affects performance either by tying up processor resources or by causing the processor to wait.

> 2. `通信延迟`——理想情况下，延迟越低越好。正如 [附录 F](#_bookmark595) 所解释的：假设没有竞争，通信延迟发送方开销 + 飞行时间 + 传输时间 + 接收方开销。飞行时间是固定的，传输时间由互连网络决定。发送和接收消息的软件和硬件开销在很大程度上取决于通信机制及其实现。为什么延迟至关重要？ 延迟会影响性能以及对多处理器进行编程的难易程度。除非延迟是隐藏的，否则它会通过占用处理器资源或导致处理器等待来直接影响性能。

Overhead and occupancy are closely related, since many forms of overhead also tie up some part of the node, incurring an occupancy cost, which in turn limits bandwidth. Key features of a communication mechanism may directly affect overhead and occupancy. For example, how is the destination address for a remote communication named, and how is protection implemented? When naming and protection mechanisms are provided by the processor, as in a shared address space, the additional overhead is small. Alternatively, if these mecha- nisms must be provided by the operating system for each communication, this increases the overhead and occupancy costs of communication, which in turn reduce bandwidth and increase latency.

> 开销和占用率密切相关，因为许多形式的开销也会占用节点的某些部分，从而产生占用成本，进而限制带宽。通信机制的关键特性可能直接影响开销和占用率。例如，远程通信的目的地址如何命名，如何实现保护？ 当处理器提供命名和保护机制时，如在共享地址空间中，额外的开销很小。或者，如果操作系统必须为每次通信提供这些机制，则会增加通信的开销和占用成本，进而减少带宽并增加延迟。

1. `Communication latency hiding`—How well can the communication mechanism hide latency by overlapping communication with computation or with other communication? Although measuring this is not as simple as measuring the first two metrics, it is an important characteristic that can be quantified by measuring the running time on multiprocessors with the same communication latency but different support for latency hiding. Although hiding latency is certainly a good idea, it poses an additional burden on the software system and ultimately on the programmer. Furthermore, the amount of latency that can be hidden is applica- tion dependent. Thus, it is usually best to reduce latency wherever possible.

> 1. `通信延迟隐藏`——通信机制如何通过与计算或其他通信重叠通信来隐藏延迟？ 虽然测量这不像测量前两个指标那么简单，但它是一个重要的特征，可以通过测量具有相同通信延迟但对延迟隐藏的不同支持的多处理器上的运行时间来量化。虽然隐藏延迟当然是个好主意，但它给软件系统带来了额外的负担，并最终给程序员带来了负担。此外，可以隐藏的延迟量取决于应用程序。因此，通常最好尽可能减少延迟。

Each of these performance measures is affected by the characteristics of the communications needed in the application, as we will see in the next section. The size of the data items being communicated is the most obvious characteristic, since it affects both latency and bandwidth directly, as well as affecting the efficacy of different latency-hiding approaches. Similarly, the regularity in the communi- cation patterns affects the cost of naming and protection, and hence the commu- nication overhead. In general, mechanisms that perform well with smaller as well as larger data communication requests, and irregular as well as regular com- munication patterns, are more flexible and efficient for a wider class of applica- tions. Of course, in considering any communication mechanism, designers must consider cost as well as performance.

> 正如我们将在下一节中看到的，这些性能指标中的每一个都受到应用程序所需通信特性的影响。正在通信的数据项的大小是最明显的特征，因为它直接影响延迟和带宽，以及影响不同延迟隐藏方法的功效。同样，通信模式的规律性会影响命名和保护的成本，从而影响通信开销。一般而言，对于更小和更大的数据通信请求以及不规则和常规通信模式都表现良好的机制对于更广泛的应用程序类别更加灵活和高效。当然，在考虑任何通信机制时，设计人员必须考虑成本和性能。

##### `Advantages of Different Communication Mechanisms`

The two primary means of communicating data in a large-scale multiprocessor are message passing and shared memory. Each of these two primary communication mechanisms has its advantages. For shared-memory communication, the advan- tages include

> 在大规模多处理器中传达数据的两种主要方法是消息传递和共享内存。这两个主要的交流机制中的每一个都有其优势。对于共享记忆交流，优势包括

- Compatibility with the well-understood mechanisms in use in centralized multiprocessors, which all use shared-memory communication. The OpenMP consortium (see `[www.openmp.org](http://www.openmp.org/)` for description) has proposed a standardized programming interface for shared-memory multiprocessors. Although mes- sage passing also uses a standard, MPI or Message Passing Interface, this stan- dard is not used either in shared-memory multiprocessors or in loosely coupled clusters in use in throughput-oriented environments.

> - 与集中式多处理器中使用的众所周知的机制兼容，这些处理器都使用共享内存通信。OpenMP 联盟(有关描述，请参阅 "[www.openmp.org](http://www.openmp.org/)" )已经为共享内存多处理器提出了一个标准化的编程接口。尽管消息传递也使用标准、MPI 或消息传递接口，但该标准既未用于共享内存多处理器，也未用于面向吞吐量的环境中使用的松耦合集群。

- Ease of programming when the communication patterns among processors are complex or vary dynamically during execution. Similar advantages simplify compiler design.

> - 在执行过程中处理器之间的通信模式复杂或动态变化时，编程的便利性。类似的优势简化了编译器设计。

- The ability to develop applications using the familiar shared-memory model, focusing attention only on those accesses that are performance critical.

> - 使用熟悉的共享记忆模型开发应用程序的能力，仅将注意力集中在绩效至关重要的访问上。

- Lower overhead for communication and better use of bandwidth when commu- nicating small items. This arises from the implicit nature of communication and the use of memory mapping to implement protection in hardware, rather than through the I/O system.

> - 较低的开销，以便在整理小物品时更好地使用带宽。这源于通信的隐含性和使用内存映射来在硬件中实现保护，而不是通过 I/O 系统。

- The ability to use hardware-controlled caching to reduce the frequency of remote communication by supporting automatic caching of all data, both shared and private. As we will see, caching reduces both latency and contention for accessing shared data. This advantage also comes with a disadvantage, which we mention below.

> - 通过支持所有共享和私有数据的自动缓存，可以使用硬件控制的缓存来减少远程通信的频率。正如我们将看到的那样，缓存可以减少访问共享数据的延迟和争议。这个优势也带来了缺点，我们在下面提到。

The major advantages for message-passing communication include the following:

> 消息通信的主要优点包括以下内容：

- The hardware can be simpler, especially by comparison with a scalable shared- memory implementation that supports coherent caching of remote data.

> - 硬件可以更简单，尤其是通过与支持远程数据连贯缓存的可扩展共享内存实现的比较。

- Communication is explicit, which means it is simpler to understand. In shared- memory models, it can be difficult to know when communication is occurring and when it is not, as well as how costly the communication is.

> - 沟通是明确的，这意味着更容易理解。在共享内存模型中，很难知道何时发生通信，何时不进行，以及通信的昂贵程度。

- Explicit communication focuses programmer attention on this costly aspect of parallel computation, sometimes leading to improved structure in a multi- processor program.

> - 明确的通信将程序员的注意力集中在平行计算的这一昂贵方面上，有时会导致多处理器程序中的结构改善。

- Synchronization is naturally associated with sending messages, reducing the possibility for errors introduced by incorrect synchronization.

> - 同步自然与发送消息相关联，从而减少了错误同步引入的错误的可能性。

- It makes it easier to use sender-initiated communication, which may have some advantages in performance.

> - 它使使用发件人发起的通信变得更加容易，这可能在性能方面具有一些优势。

- If the communication is less frequent and more structured, it is easier to improve fault tolerance by using a transaction-like structure. Furthermore, the less tight coupling of nodes and explicit communication make fault isola- tion simpler.

> - 如果通信较不频繁，结构化较高，则使用类似交易的结构更容易提高容错。此外，节点和显式通信的紧密耦合使故障隔离更简单。

- The very largest multiprocessors use a cluster structure, which is inherently based on message passing. Using two different communication models may introduce more complexity than is warranted.

> - 最大的多处理器使用群集结构，该结构固有地基于消息传递。使用两个不同的通信模型可能会引入比保证更复杂的。

Of course, the desired communication model can be created in software on top of a hardware model that supports either of these mechanisms. Supporting message passing on top of shared memory is considerably easier: Because messages essen- tially send data from one memory to another, sending a message can be implemen- ted by doing a copy from one portion of the address space to another. The major difficulties arise from dealing with messages that may be misaligned and of arbi- trary length in a memory system that is normally oriented toward transferring aligned blocks of data organized as cache blocks. These difficulties can be over- come either with small performance penalties in software or with essentially no penalties, using a small amount of hardware support.

> 当然，可以在支持这些机制的硬件模型之上的软件中创建所需的通信模型。支持在共享内存之上传递消息要容易得多：因为消息本质上是将数据从一个内存发送到另一个内存，所以发送消息可以通过从地址空间的一部分复制到另一部分来实现。主要的困难来自于处理**可能未对齐和任意长度**的消息在一个内存系统中，该内存系统通常面向传输对齐的数据块组织为高速缓存块。这些困难可以通过软件中的小性能损失或基本上没有损失，使用少量硬件支持来克服。

Supporting shared memory efficiently on top of hardware for message passing is much more difficult. Without explicit hardware support for shared memory, all shared-memory references need to involve the operating system to provide address translation and memory protection, as well as to translate memory references into message sends and receives. Loads and stores usually move small amounts of data, so the high overhead of handling these communications in software severely limits the range of applications for which the performance of software-based shared memory is acceptable. For these reasons, it has never been practical to use message passing to implement shared memory for a commercial system.

> 在硬件之上有效地支持共享内存以进行消息传递要困难得多。如果没有对共享内存的显式硬件支持，所有共享内存引用都需要操作系统提供地址转换和内存保护，以及将内存引用转换为消息发送和接收。加载和存储通常移动少量数据，因此在软件中处理这些通信的高开销严重限制了可以接受基于软件的共享内存性能的应用程序范围。由于这些原因，使用消息传递来为商业系统实现共享内存从来都不现实。
