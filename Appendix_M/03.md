### The First General-Purpose Electronic Computers

> ###第一个通用电子计算机

J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the Moore School of the University of Pennsylvania built the world’s first fully operational electronic general-purpose computer. This machine, called ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator), was funded by the U.S. Army and became operational during World War II, but it was not publicly disclosed until 1946. ENIAC was used for comput- ing artillery firing tables. The machine was enormous—100 feet long, 8½ feet high, and several feet wide. Each of the 20 ten-digit registers was 2 feet long. In total, there were 18,000 vacuum tubes.

> 宾夕法尼亚大学摩尔学校的 J. Presper Eckert 和 John Mauchly 建造了世界上第一个全面运行的电子通用计算机。这台被称为 ENIAC(电子数值集成商和计算器)的机器由美国陆军资助，并在第二次世界大战期间开始运营，但直到 1946 年才公开披露。ENIAC 用于计算炮弹射击桌。机器巨大 - 长 100 英尺，高 8.5 英尺，宽几英尺。20 个十位寄存器中的每一个都长 2 英尺。总共有 18,000 个真空管。

Although the size was three orders of magnitude bigger than the size of the average machines built today, it was more than five orders of magnitude slower, with an add taking 200 microseconds. The ENIAC provided conditional jumps and was programmable, which clearly distinguished it from earlier calculators. Programming was done manually by plugging up cables and setting switches and required from a half hour to a whole day. Data were provided on punched cards. The ENIAC was limited primarily by a small amount of storage and tedious programming.

> 尽管大小比当今建造的平均机器的尺寸大三个数量级，但它慢了五个数量级以上，增加了 200 微秒。ENIAC 提供了有条件的跳跃，并且是可编程的，这显然将其与早期的计算器区分开。编程是通过堵塞电缆和设置开关来手动完成的，并且需要从半小时到整整一天。在打孔卡上提供了数据。ENIAC 主要受到少量存储和繁琐的编程的限制。

In 1944, John von Neumann was attracted to the ENIAC project. The group wanted to improve the way programs were entered and discussed storing programs as numbers; von Neumann helped crystallize the ideas and wrote a memo propos- ing a stored-program computer called EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable

> 1944 年，约翰·冯·诺伊曼(John von Neumann)被 Eniac 项目吸引。该小组希望改善程序的输入方式，并讨论存储程序作为数字；冯·诺伊曼(Von Neumann

Automatic Computer). Herman Goldstine distributed the memo and put von Neu- mann’s name on it, much to the dismay of Eckert and Mauchly, whose names were omitted. This memo has served as the basis for the commonly used term _von Neumann computer_. Several early inventors in the computer field believe that this term gives too much credit to von Neumann, who conceptualized and wrote up the ideas, and too little to the engineers, Eckert and Mauchly, who worked on the machines. Like most historians, your authors (winners of the 2000 IEEE von Neumann Medal) believe that all three individuals played a key role in developing the stored-program computer. Von Neumann’s role in writing up the ideas, in gen- eralizing them, and in thinking about the programming aspects was critical in trans- ferring the ideas to a wider audience.

> 自动计算机)。赫尔曼·戈德斯汀(Herman Goldstine)分发了备忘录，并将冯·诺伊曼(Von Neumann)的名字放在上面，这让埃克特(Eckert)和莫克利(Mauchly)感到沮丧，他们的名字被省略了。该备忘录已成为常用术语_von neumann Computer_的基础。计算机领域中的几位早期发明者认为，这个术语给冯·诺伊曼(Von Neumann)提供了太多的信誉，冯·诺伊曼(Von Neumann)概念化并写了这些想法，而工程师 Eckert 和 Mauchly 对在机器上工作的工作很少。像大多数历史学家一样，您的作家(2000 年 IEEE von Neumann 勋章的获奖者)认为，这三个人在开发存储的计算机中发挥了关键作用。冯·诺伊曼(von Neumann)在写出思想，赋予这些思想以及思考编程方面的角色方面的作用对于将思想传递给更广泛的受众至关重要。

In 1946, Maurice Wilkes of Cambridge University visited the Moore School to attend the latter part of a series of lectures on developments in electronic com- puters. When he returned to Cambridge, Wilkes decided to embark on a project to build a stored-program computer named EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator). (The EDSAC used mercury delay lines for its memory; hence, the phrase “delay storage” in its name.) The EDSAC became operational in 1949 and was the world’s first full-scale, operational, stored-program computer [Wilkes, Wheeler, and Gill 1951; Wilkes 1985, 1995]. (A small prototype called the Mark I, which was built at the University of Manchester and ran in 1948, might be called the first operational stored-program machine.) The EDSAC was an accumulator-based architecture. This style of instruction set architecture remained popular until the early 1970s. ([Appendix A](#_bookmark391) starts with a brief summary of the EDSAC instruction set.)

> 1946 年，剑桥大学的莫里斯·威尔克斯(Maurice Wilkes)访问了摩尔学校，参加了有关电子综合商的发展的一系列讲座。当他返回剑桥时，威尔克斯决定着手制造一个名为 EDSAC 的存储程序计算机(电子延迟存储自动计算器)。(EDSAC 使用汞延迟线作为其内存；因此，以其名称为“延迟存储”一词。)Edsac 于 1949 年开始运行，是世界上第一个全面的，运营的，存储的，存储的计算机[Wilkes，Wheeler，Wheeler，，和 Gill 1951；威尔克斯(Wilkes)1985，1995]。(一个名为 Mark I 的小型原型，该原型是在曼彻斯特大学建造的，并于 1948 年跑步，可能被称为第一台操作存储程序机器。)EDSAC 是基于累加器的建筑。直到 1970 年代初期，这种教学套装式建筑风格一直很受欢迎。([附录 A](#_ bookmark391)以 EDSAC 指令集的简要摘要开始。

In 1947, Mauchly took the time to help found the Association for Computing Machinery. He served as the ACM’s first vice-president and second president. That same year, Eckert and Mauchly applied for a patent on electronic computers. The dean of the Moore School, by demanding that the patent be turned over to the university, may have helped Eckert and Mauchly conclude that they should leave. Their departure crippled the EDVAC project, which did not become operational until 1952.

> 1947 年，Mauchly 花了一些时间帮助建立了计算机协会。他曾担任 ACM 的第一任副总统和第二任总统。同年，Eckert 和 Mauchly 在电子计算机上申请了专利。摩尔学校的院长要求将专利移交给大学，可能帮助 Eckert 和 Mauchly 得出结论，他们应该离开。他们的离开削弱了 EDVAC 项目，直到 1952 年才开始运营。

Goldstine left to join von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 1946. Together with Arthur Burks, they issued a report based on the 1944 memo [Burks, Goldstine, and von Neumann 1946]. The paper led to the IAS machine built by Julian Bigelow at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study. It had a total of 1024 40-bit words and was roughly 10 times faster than ENIAC. The group thought about uses for the machine, published a set of reports, and encouraged visitors. These reports and visitors inspired the development of a number of new computers, including the first IBM computer, the 701, which was based on the IAS machine. The paper by Burks, Goldstine, and von Neumann was incredible for the period. Reading it today, you would never guess this landmark paper was written more than 50 years ago, as most of the architectural concepts seen in modern computers are discussed there (e.g., see the quote at the beginning of [Chapter 2](#_bookmark46)).

> 戈德斯汀(Goldstine)于 1946 年在普林斯顿(Princeton)的高级研究所加入冯·诺伊曼(Von Neumann)。该论文导致了普林斯顿高级研究所朱利安·比格洛(Julian Bigelow)建造的 IAS 机器。它总共有 1024 位 40 位单词，比 Eniac 快 10 倍。该小组考虑了机器的用途，发布了一组报告，并鼓励了访客。这些报告和访问者启发了许多新计算机的开发，包括基于 IAS 机器的第一台 IBM 计算机 701。Burks，Goldstine 和 Von Neumann 的报纸在此期间令人难以置信。今天阅读它，您永远不会猜到这篇里程碑式的论文是在 50 年前写的，因为在那里讨论了现代计算机中看到的大多数建筑概念(例如，请参见[第 2 章](#_ bookmark46)开始时的报价。)。

In the same time period as ENIAC, Howard Aiken was designing an electro- mechanical computer called the Mark-I at Harvard. The Mark-I was built by a team of engineers from IBM. He followed the Mark-I with a relay machine, the Mark-II, and a pair of vacuum tube machines, the Mark-III and Mark-IV. The Mark-III and Mark-IV were built after the first stored-program machines. Because they had separate memories for instructions and data, the machines were regarded as reactionary by the advocates of stored-program computers. The term _Harvard architecture_ was coined to describe this type of machine. Though clearly different from the original sense, this term is used today to apply to machines with a single main memory but with separate instruction and data caches.

> 在与 Eniac 的同一时期，霍华德·艾肯(Howard Aiken)正在哈佛设计一台称为 Mark-I 的电机。Mark-I 是由 IBM 的一组工程师组成的。他用继电器机，标记 II 和一对真空管机，Mark-III 和 Mark-IV 跟随 Mark-I。Mark-III 和 Mark-IV 是在第一个存储程序机之后构建的。由于它们有有关指令和数据的单独记忆，因此这些机器被存储程序计算机的拥护者认为是反动的。_harvard Architecture 一词是为了描述这种类型的机器。尽管显然与原始意义不同，但该术语今天用于应用于具有单个主内存的计算机，但具有单独的指令和数据缓存。

The Whirlwind project [Redmond and Smith 1980] began at MIT in 1947 and was aimed at applications in real-time radar signal processing. Although it led to several inventions, its overwhelming innovation was the creation of magnetic core memory, the first reliable and inexpensive memory technology. Whirlwind had 2048 16-bit words of magnetic core. Magnetic cores served as the main memory technology for nearly 30 years.

### Important Special-Purpose Machines

> ###重要专用机器

During World War II, major computing efforts in both Great Britain and the United States focused on special-purpose code-breaking computers. The work in Great Britain was aimed at decrypting messages encoded with the German Enigma coding machine. This work, which occurred at a location called Bletchley Park, led to two important machines. The first, an electromechanical machine, conceived of by Alan Turing, was called BOMB [see Good in Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota 1980]. The second, much larger and electronic machine, conceived and designed by Newman and Flowers, was called COLOSSUS [see Randall in Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota 1980]. These were highly specialized cryptanalysis machines, which played a vital role in the war by providing the ability to read coded messages, especially those sent to U-boats. The work at Bletchley Park was highly classified (indeed, some of it is still classified), so its direct impact on the development of ENIAC, EDSAC, and other computers is difficult to trace, but it certainly had an indirect effect in advancing the technology and gaining understanding of the issues.

> 在第二次世界大战期间，英国和美国的主要计算工作都集中在特殊的代码破坏计算机上。英国的作品旨在解释用德国谜编码机编码的消息。这项工作发生在一个名为 Bletchley Park 的位置，导致了两台重要的机器。第一台由艾伦·图灵(Alan Turing)构想的机电机器被称为炸弹[参见大都会，霍利特(Howlett)和罗塔(Rota)1980]。第二台由纽曼和鲜花构思和设计的更大和电子机器被称为巨像[见大都会，霍利特和罗塔 1980 年的兰德尔]。这些是高度专业化的密码分析机，通过提供读取编码消息的能力，尤其是发送给 U 型船的能力，在战争中发挥了至关重要的作用。Bletchley Park 的工作非常高度分类(实际上，其中一些仍然是分类的)，因此它对 ENIAC，EDSAC 和其他计算机的开发的直接影响很难追踪，但是它在推进技术方面肯定具有间接的影响并了解问题。

Similar work on special-purpose computers for cryptanalysis went on in the United States. The most direct descendent of this effort was the company Engineer- ing Research Associates (ERA) [see Thomash in Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota 1980], which was founded after the war to attempt to commercialize on the key ideas. ERA built several machines that were sold to secret government agencies, and it was eventually purchased by Sperry-Rand, which had earlier purchased the Eckert Mauchly Computer Corporation.

> 在美国进行了类似的用于密码分析的专用计算机的工作。这项工作中最直接的后裔是公司工程研究伙伴(ERA)[参见大都会，Howlett 和 Rota 1980]的托马什，该公司是在战争之后建立的，试图在关键思想上商业化。ERA 制造了几台机器，这些机器被出售给秘密政府机构，最终被 Sperry-Rand 购买，Sperry-Rand 早些时候购买了 Eckert Mauchly Computer Corporation。

Another early set of machines that deserves credit was a group of special- purpose machines built by Konrad Zuse in Germany in the late 1930s and early 1940s [see Bauer and Zuse in Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota 1980]. In addition to producing an operating machine, Zuse was the first to implement floating point, which von Neumann claimed was unnecessary! His early machines used a mechanical store that was smaller than other electromechanical solutions of the time. His last machine was electromechanical but, because of the war, was never completed.

> 另一套值得赞誉的机器是由 Konrad Zuse 在 1930 年代末和 1940 年代初在德国建造的一组特殊目的机器[参见 Metropolis，Howlett 和 Rota 1980 的 Bauer and Zuse]。除了生产操作机外，Zuse 是第一个实施浮点的人，冯·诺伊曼(Von Neumann)声称这是不必要的！他的早期机器使用的机械商店比当时其他机电溶液小。他的最后一台机器是机电的，但由于战争，他从未完成。

An important early contributor to the development of electronic computers was John Atanasoff, who built a small-scale electronic computer in the early 1940s [Ata- nasoff 1940]. His machine, designed at Iowa State University, was a special-purpose computer (called the ABC, for Atanasoff Berry Computer) that was never completely operational. Mauchly briefly visited Atanasoff before he built ENIAC, and several of Atanasoff’s ideas (e.g., using binary representation) likely influenced Mauchly. The presence of the Atanasoff machine, delays in filing the ENIAC pat- ents (the work was classified, and patents could not be filed until after the war), and the distribution of von Neumann’s EDVAC paper were used to break the Eckert– Mauchly patent [Larson 1973]. Though controversy still rages over Atanasoff’s role, Eckert and Mauchly are usually given credit for building the first working, general-purpose, electronic computer [Stern 1980]. Atanasoff, however, demon- strated several important innovations included in later computers. Atanasoff deserves much credit for his work, and he might fairly be given credit for the world’s first special-purpose electronic computer and for possibly influencing Eckert and Mauchly.

> 电子计算机开发的一个重要早期贡献者是约翰·阿塔纳索夫(John Atanasoff)，他在 1940 年代初(Atanasoff 1940 年)建造了一台小型电子计算机。他在爱荷华州立大学设计的机器是一款专用计算机(称为 ABC，用于 Atanasoff Berry 计算机)，从未完全运行。毛奇(Mauchly)在建立恩尼亚克(Eniac)之前短暂访问了阿塔纳索夫(Atanasoff)，而阿塔纳索夫(Atanasoff)的一些想法(例如，使用二进制代表)可能会影响毛 chly。Atanasoff 机器的存在，提交材料的延迟(作品已分类，直到战后才能申请专利)，并使用冯·诺伊曼(Von Neumann)的 EDVAC 论文的分布来破坏 Eckert  -  Mauchly Patet pantent[Larson 1973]。尽管争议仍然激起了阿塔纳索夫(Atanasoff)的角色，但埃克特(Eckert)和莫克利(Mauchly)通常因建立第一台工作，通用，电子计算机而受到赞誉[Stern 1980]。然而，阿塔纳索夫(Atanasoff)阐述了后来计算机中包括的几项重要创新。阿塔纳索夫(Atanasoff)值得他的工作值得称赞，他可能会因世界上第一款特殊用途的电子计算机以及可能影响埃克特(Eckert)和毛切(Mauchly)而受到赞誉。

### Commercial Developments

> ###商业发展

In December 1947, Eckert and Mauchly formed Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation. Their first machine, the BINAC, was built for Northrop and was shown in August 1949. After some financial difficulties, the Eckert-Mauchly Com- puter Corporation was acquired by Remington-Rand, later called Sperry-Rand. Sperry-Rand merged the Eckert-Mauchly acquisition, ERA, and its tabulating business to form a dedicated computer division, called UNIVAC. UNIVAC deliv- ered its first computer, the UNIVAC I, in June 1951. The UNIVAC I sold for $250,000 and was the first successful commercial computer—48 systems were built! Today, this early machine, along with many other fascinating pieces of com- puter lore, can be seen at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. Other places where early computing systems can be visited include the Deutsches Museum in Munich and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., as well as numerous online virtual museums.

> 1947 年 12 月，Eckert 和 Mauchly 成立了 Eckert-Mauchly 计算机公司。他们的第一台机器 The Binac 是为诺斯罗普(Northrop)建造的，并于 1949 年 8 月展出。在经济困难之后，Eckert-Mauchly Compoter Corporation 被雷明顿 - 兰德(Remington-Rand)收购，后来被称为 Sperry-Rand。Sperry-Rand 合并了 Eckert-Mauchly 的收购，ERA 及其制表业务，形成了一个专门的计算机部门，称为 Univac。UNIVAC 在 1951 年 6 月制作了第一台计算机，即 UnivacI。我以 25 万美元的价格售出的 Univac，是第一台成功的商用计算机-48 个系统！如今，这台早期的机器以及许多其他引人入胜的 Compoter Lore 可以在加利福尼亚州山景城的计算机历史博物馆中看到。可以参观早期计算系统的其他地方包括慕尼黑的德意志博物馆和华盛顿特区的史密森尼机构以及众多在线虚拟博物馆。

IBM, which earlier had been in the punched card and office automation busi- ness, didn’t start building computers until 1950. The first IBM computer, the IBM 701 based on von Neumann’s IAS machine, shipped in 1952 and eventually sold 19 units [see Hurd in Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota 1980]. In the early 1950s, many people were pessimistic about the future of computers, believing that the market and opportunities for these “highly specialized” machines were quite lim- ited. Nonetheless, IBM quickly became the most successful computer company. Their focus on reliability and customer- and market-driven strategies were key. Although the 701 and 702 were modest successes, IBM’s follow-up machines, the 650, 704, and 705 (delivered in 1954 and 1955) were significant successes, each selling from 132 to 1800 computers.

> IBM 早些时候曾在打孔卡和办公室自动化业务中，直到 1950 年才开始构建计算机。第一台 IBM 计算机，即基于 von Neumann 的 IAS 机器的 IBM 701，于 1952 年发货，最终出售了 19 台[参见大都会，Howlett 和 Rota 1980 的 Hurd]。在 1950 年代初期，许多人对计算机的未来感到悲观，他们认为这些“高度专业”机器的市场和机遇是相当艰难的。尽管如此，IBM 迅速成为最成功的计算机公司。他们关注可靠性以及客户和市场驱动的策略是关键。尽管 701 和 702 取得了微不足道的成功，但 IBM 的后续机器，650、704 和 705(1954 年和 1955 年交付)取得了巨大的成功，每台都从 132 到 1800 台销售。

Several books describing the early days of computing have been written by the pioneers [Goldstine 1972; Wilkes 1985, 1995], as well as Metropolis, Howlett, and Rota [1980], which is a collection of recollections by early pioneers. There are numerous independent histories, often built around the people involved [Slater 1987], as well as a journal, _Annals of the History of Computing_, devoted to the history of computing.

> 几本描述了计算早期的书籍是由先驱者撰写的[Goldstine 1972;Wilkes 1985，1995]以及大都会，Howlett 和 Rota [1980]，这是早期先驱者的回忆集。有许多独立的历史，经常围绕相关人员建立[Slater 1987]以及日记，即计算史的纪录，专门研究计算史。

### Development of Quantitative Performance Measures: Successes and Failures

> ###制定定量绩效指标：成功和失败

In the earliest days of computing, designers set performance goals—ENIAC was to be 1000 times faster than the Harvard Mark-I, and the IBM Stretch (7030) was to be 100 times faster than the fastest machine in existence. What wasn’t clear, though, was how this performance was to be measured. In looking back over the years, it is a consistent theme that each generation of computers obsoletes the performance evaluation techniques of the prior generation.

> 在计算最早的日子里，设计师设定了性能目标 - 持续效果要比哈佛大学的速度快 1000 倍，而 IBM 拉伸(7030)的速度要比现有最快的机器快 100 倍。不过，尚不清楚的是如何衡量这种表现。回顾过去的几年，每一代计算机都淘汰了上一代的性能评估技术是一个一致的主题。

The original measure of performance was time to perform an individual oper- ation, such as addition. Since most instructions took the same execution time, the timing of one gave insight into the others. As the execution times of instructions in a machine became more diverse, however, the time for one operation was no longer useful for comparisons. To take these differences into account, an _instruction mix_ was calculated by measuring the relative frequency of instructions in a computer across many programs. The Gibson mix [Gibson 1970] was an early popular instruction mix. Multiplying the time for each instruction times its weight in the mix gave the user the _average instruction execution time_. (If measured in clock cycles, average instruction execution time is the same as average cycles per instruc- tion.) Since instruction sets were similar, this was a more accurate comparison than add times. From average instruction execution time, then, it was only a small step to MIPS (as we have seen, the one is the inverse of the other). MIPS had the virtue of being easy for the layperson to understand.

> 绩效的原始度量是进行单个操作的时候，例如加法。由于大多数说明花费了相同的执行时间，因此一个人的时机洞悉了其他指示。但是，随着机器中指令的执行时间变得越来越多样，但是，一次操作的时间不再对比较有用。为了考虑这些差异，通过测量许多程序中计算机中指令的相对频率来计算_ Instructuction Mix_。Gibson Mix [Gibson 1970]是一种早期的流行指导组合。将每个指令的时间乘以其在混合物中的重量，使用户可以执行_aaverage 指令执行时间_。(如果以时钟循环为单位，则平均指令执行时间与每次指示的平均周期相同。)由于指令集相似，因此比较比较时间更准确。从平均指令执行时间开始，这只是 MIPS 的一小步(如我们所见，一个是另一个的倒数)。MIPS 具有容易让外行人理解的优点。

As CPUs became more sophisticated and relied on memory hierarchies and pipelining, there was no longer a single execution time per instruction; MIPS could not be calculated from the mix and the manual. The next step was benchmarking using kernels and synthetic programs. Curnow and Wichmann [1976] created the Whetstone synthetic program by measuring scientific programs written in Algol

> 随着 CPU 变得越来越复杂，并依赖内存层次结构和管道，每个说明不再有单个执行时间。无法通过混合和手册来计算 MIP。下一步是使用内核和合成程序进行基准测试。Curnow and Wichmann [1976]通过测量 Algol 编写的科学程序创建了 Whetstone 合成程序

60\. This program was converted to FORTRAN and was widely used to character- ize scientific program performance. An effort with similar goals to Whetstone, the Livermore FORTRAN Kernels, was made by McMahon [1986] and researchers at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in an attempt to establish a benchmark for super- computers. These kernels, however, consisted of loops from real programs.

> 60 \。该程序已转换为 Fortran，并广泛用于特征科学计划的表现。McMahon [1986]和 Lawrence Livermore 实验室的研究人员实现了与 Whetstone 类似目标的努力，Livermore Fortran 内核是为了建立超级计算机的基准。但是，这些内核包括来自真实程序的循环。

As it became clear that using MIPS to compare architectures with different instruction sets would not work, a notion of relative MIPS was created. When the VAX-11/780 was ready for announcement in 1977, DEC ran small benchmarks that were also run on an IBM 370/158. IBM marketing referred to the 370/158 as a 1 MIPS computer, and, because the programs ran at the same speed, DEC market- ing called the VAX-11/780 a 1 MIPS computer. Relative MIPS for a machine M was defined based on some reference machine as:

> 很明显，使用 MIPS 比较具有不同指令集的体系结构是行不通的，因此创建了相对 MIP 的概念。当 Vax-11/780 在 1977 年准备公告时，DEC 运行了小型基准，这些基准也在 IBM 370/158 上运行。IBM Marketing 将 370/158 称为 1 MIPS 计算机，并且由于程序以相同的速度运行，因此 DEC 市场称为 VAX-11/780 A 1 MIPS 计算机。机器 M 的相对 MIP 是根据某些参考机的定义的，为：

The popularity of the VAX-11/780 made it a popular reference machine for relative MIPS, especially since relative MIPS for a 1 MIPS computer is easy to calculate: If a machine was five times faster than the VAX-11/780, for that benchmark its rating would be 5 relative MIPS. The 1 MIPS rating was unquestioned for 4 years, until Joel Emer of DEC measured the VAX-11/780 under a time-sharing load. He found that the VAX-11/780 native MIPS rating was 0.5. Subsequent VAXes that ran 3 native MIPS for some benchmarks were therefore called 6 MIPS machines because they ran six times faster than the VAX-11/780. By the early 1980s, the term _MIPS_ was almost universally used to mean relative MIPS.

> VAX-11/780 的受欢迎程度使其成为相对 MIP 的流行参考机，尤其是因为 1 MIPS 计算机的相对 MIP 易于计算：如果机器比 VAX-11/780 快五倍，为此基准的评级为 5 个相对 MIP。1 年的 1 个 MIP 额定值持续了 4 年，直到 DEC 的 Joel Emer 在时间共享负载下测量 VAX-11/780。他发现 VAX-11/780 本机 MIP 额定值为 0.5。因此，随后的一些基准测试的天然 MIPS 的 VAX 被称为 6 个 MIPS 机器，因为它们的运行速度比 VAX-11/780 快六倍。到 1980 年代初，术语_mips_几乎被普遍用来表示相对 MIP。

The 1970s and 1980s marked the growth of the supercomputer industry, which was defined by high performance on floating-point-intensive programs. Average instruction time and MIPS were clearly inappropriate metrics for this industry, hence the invention of MFLOPS (millions of floating-point operations per second), which effectively measured the inverse of execution time for a bench- mark. Unfortunately, customers quickly forget the program used for the rating, and marketing groups decided to start quoting peak MFLOPS in the supercomputer performance wars.

> 1970 年代和 1980 年代标志着超级计算机行业的增长，该行业的定义是在浮点密集型计划中的高性能。平均指导时间和 MIPS 显然是该行业的不适当指标，因此 MFLOPS 的发明(每秒数百万浮点操作)有效地测量了基准的执行时间的倒数。不幸的是，客户很快忘记了用于评级的程序，营销小组决定开始引用超级计算机性能战争中的峰值 MFLOP。

SPEC (System Performance and Evaluation Cooperative) was founded in the late 1980s to try to improve the state of benchmarking and make a more valid basis for comparison. The group initially focused on workstations and servers in the UNIX marketplace, and these remain the primary focus of these benchmarks today. The first release of SPEC benchmarks, now called SPEC89, was a substantial improvement in the use of more realistic benchmarks. SPEC2006 still dominates processor benchmarks almost two decades later.

> SPEC(系统性能和评估合作社)于 1980 年代后期建立，以试图改善基准测试状态，并为比较提供更有效的基础。该小组最初专注于 UNIX 市场的工作站和服务器，这些仍然是当今这些基准测试的主要重点。SPEC 基准的第一个版本(现在称为 Spec89)在使用更现实的基准测试方面有了很大的改进。Spec2006 仍在二十年后统治处理器基准。
